TODO:

  * Do we need to add support for plugins init, quit, etc.?
  * Better interoperability with Python version
  * Sugar datastore/toolbar support
  * Unit tests
  * Make error messages extendable with plugins.

FEATURE IDEAS:
  * Local variables? (e.g., boxes only defined inside an action?) Note that
    we can use turtlename to create instance variables.
  * Pass argments to actions? (and arg blocks to reference them)?
  * Arrays
  * Color mixer that outputs a stack: set hue; set value; set chroma.

ISSUES:
  * Find a scalable approach to drawing on the canvas
  * Need to define a break behaviour from with stacks

KNOWN BUGS:
  * Not all blocks highlight when using step-by-step mode
  * Sometimes returning to backgrounded project results in empty project
  * Loading macros there is a funny collapsed state sometimes.
  * Somehow we end up in a browser resize loop??? (2842 console messages are
    not shown js/activity.js:770)
  * Python show block not compatible with JS show block.
  * Not serious, but there is still a race condition when creating
    if-then-else blocks (so there is a work-around in place).
  * Sometimes clamp block highlight scale is too large.
  * Sometimes docking position is not scaled properly when dragging block
    after block resize.

ANDROID-SPECIFIC BUGS:
  * Camera doesn't work on Android
  * Music block doesn't work on Android
  * Cannot open plugins loader on Android

SUGAR-SPECIFIC BUGS:
