#### Current State

<!-- A brief description of what the current circumstance is. -->

The README.md file lacks a dedicated troubleshooting section. Users encountering common issues (port conflicts, npm errors, audio problems, Docker issues, etc.) have no built-in help within the README. This leads to:

- Increased support burden on maintainers
- Multiple duplicate GitHub issues for the same problems
- Slower user onboarding and higher user frustration
- Users creating issues that could be self-served

#### Desired State

<!-- A brief description of the necessary action to take. -->

Add a comprehensive **Troubleshooting** section to README.md that includes solutions for:

1. Port 3000 is Already in Use (Windows/macOS/Linux commands)
2. npm install Fails with Permission Errors
3. Browser Shows Blank Page or Blocks Not Displaying
4. No Sound/Audio Not Working
5. Docker Container Won't Start
6. npm run lint Fails with Formatting Errors
7. Application Runs Slowly or Freezes
8. Module Not Found Errors
9. Still Having Issues (escalation path)

Each problem includes:
- Clear problem description
- Step-by-step solutions
- Platform-specific commands (PowerShell for Windows, Bash for macOS/Linux)
- Links to relevant documentation

**Location:** Between "Using Music Blocks" and "Code of Conduct" sections in README.md

**Expected Benefits:**
- 30-50% reduction in duplicate support issues
- Faster user onboarding (5-10 minutes vs hours)
- Better user experience and project reputation
- Professional, comprehensive documentation
