## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Music Blocks team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Music Blocks, please **do not** report it through public GitHub issues.

Instead, please report it via one of the following methods:

1.  **Email:** Send the details to the project maintainers directly.
2.  **Private Disclosure:** If available, use the "Report a vulnerability" button on the GitHub Security advisory page.

Please include the following details in your report:
* Description of the location and potential impact of the vulnerability.
* A detailed description of the steps required to reproduce the vulnerability (POC scripts, screenshots, and compressed packet captures are all helpful to us).

### Response Timeline

We will make every effort to:
* Acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
* Provide a timeline for the fix once the vulnerability is verified.
* Notify you when the fix is released.
