# __How to add new blocks__

This section describes how to add new blocks to Music Blocks in order
to add functionality.

Note: Almost all block related code is located inside `js/blocks`

To add a new block you first need to determine if you want to add it
to an existing palette or to create a new palette.

* If you want to add the block to an existing palette, skip the
  following section and jump right to [How to define a new
  block](#how-to-define-a-new-block).

* If you need a new palette (uncommon), you need to declare a new file
  corresponding to that palette inside `js/blocks`. Steps for the same
  are defined [here](#how-to-define-a-new-palette-for-adding-blocks).

## How to define a new palette for adding blocks

You may skip this section if the block you are adding doesn't require
a new palette.

1. Make a new file in `js/blocks` with a meaningful name. Current
files are `GraphicsBlocks.js`, `MediaBlocks.js`, et al.

2. Add the new file to `MUSICBLOCKS_EXTRAS` in `js/activity.js`.

3. Create a `setup` function in your new file at the end, with a
meaningful name, e.g. `setupGraphicsBlocks()`.

4. Call that setup function in `js/basicblocks.js` from the
`initBasicProtoBlocks()` function.

After the above steps are complete, move to [defining a new
block](#how-to-define-a-new-block)

## How to define a new block

1. Find the file in `js/blocks` associated with the palette to which
you want to add your new block.

2. Create a new class inside that file for your block.

Block classes can also extend each other. Your class definition and
`super()` call should follow this syntax:

```
    // one block extending another
    class UniqueNameBlock extends SomeBlockClass{
      constructor() {
        super(uniquename);
      }
    }
```

3. Assign a palette to the block, e.g. `this.setPalette('yourPaletteName);`

At this point your class definition should look similar to this:

```
  class UniqueNameBlock extends SomeBlockClass{
    constructor() {
      super(uniquename);
      this.setPalette('paletteName');
    }
  }
```

The color of the block is defined by the palette used.

4. To designate a block for `beginnerMode`, add
`this.beginnerBlock(true);` to the constructor.

5. To add a help string, add `this.setHelpString([_('some block
help'), 'documentation', null, 'macroname']);` to the constructor. The
first element in the list is the help string itself. The second
element is the subdirectory where the help artwork is found. The third
argument is the name of the help artwork file (null indicates that the
block name is used for the help file, e.g., blockname_block.svg). The
final element in the list is an optional macro to be loaded when the
download button is pressed in the help widget.

6. If your block is a `parameter` block, you may want to add a
function for updating the display of the parameter value during debug
mode. Typically something like this:

```
    updateParameter(logo, turtle, blk) {
	return toFixed2(logo.blocks.blockList[blk].value);
    }
```

7. You may also want to add a `setter` function so your block can be
used with the `Add-1` and `Add to` blocks.

```
    setter(logo, value, turtle, blk) {
        logo.turtles.turtleList[turtle].painter.doSetHeading(value);
    }
```

8. Add a call to `new myNewBlock.setup()` in the previously defined
`setup` function, e.g.

```
function setupUniqueBlocks() {`
  new UniqueNameBlock().setup();
}
```

For arg blocks, define a function `arg` inside the block class
definition. There are four arguments currently passed to this function
viz. `(logo, turtle, blk, receivedArg)`, e.g.

```
 class UniqueNameBlock extends SomeBlockClass{
    constructor() {
      super(uniquename);
      this.setPalette('paletteName');
    }

    arg(logo, turtle, blk, receivedArg) {
    }
}
```

For flow bocks define a function `flow` on the block. The same four
arguments are passed to the flow function currently: `(logo, turtle,
blk, receivedArg)`, e.g

```
class UniqueNameBlock extends SomeBlockClass{
    constructor() {
      super(uniquename);
      this.setPalette('paletteName');
    }

    flow(args, logo, turtle, blk, receivedArg) {
    }
}
```

Note: Trailing arguments can be neglected in both functions, if not needed.

9. Write the logic for the block in either of the two functions,
`arg()` or `flow()`.

* For arg blocks value is set by using a `return` statement.

* In case of flow blocks, return value should be in the form
  `[childFlow, childFlowCount]` or `[]` if if there is no child
  flow. (A child flow is, for example, the internal flow of a clamp,
  e.g. what is repeated in a repeat block.)

Changes to these variables should be checked and `return` keyword
should be used.

An arg block:

```
  class TranspositionFactorBlock extends ValueBlock {
    constructor() {
        //.TRANS: musical transposition (adjustment of pitch up or down)
        super('transpositionfactor', _('transposition'));
        this.setPalette('pitch');
        this.hidden = true;
    }

    arg(logo, turtle, blk) {
        if (logo.inStatusMatrix && logo.blocks.blockList[logo.blocks.blockList[blk].connections[0]].name === 'print') {
            logo.statusFields.push([blk, 'transposition']);
        } else {
            return logo.transposition[turtle];
        }
    }
}
```

A flow block:

```
class UniqueNameBlock extends SomeBlockClass{
    constructor() {
      super(uniquename);
      this.setPalette('paletteName');
    }

    flow(args) {  // Trailing arguments neglected
        if (args.length === 1)
            return [args[0], 1];
    }
}
```

## Macro expansions

In some cases, you may want a block on the palette to expand into a stack
of blocks.

Note: Macro related code is no longed written in `macros.js`

To add a macro:

Write definition using `this.makeMacro((x, y) => [....])`

```
class StartDrumBlock extends StartBlock {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.changeName('startdrum');

        this.formBlock({ name: _('start drum') });

        this.makeMacro((x, y) => [
            [0, 'start', x, y, [null, 1, null]],
            [1, 'setdrum', 0, 0,[0, 2, null, 3]],
            [2, ['drumname', {'value': 'kick drum'}], 0, 0, [1]],
            [3, 'hidden', 0, 0, [1, null]]
        ])
    }
}
```

## Examples

### A flow block:

  ```
    class DispatchBlock extends FlowBlock {
    constructor() {
        super('dispatch');
        this.setPalette('action');

        //.TRANS: dispatch an event to trigger a listener
        this.formBlock({
            name: _('broadcast'),
            args: 1,
            defaults: [_('event')],
            argTypes: ['textin'],
        });
    }

    flow(args, logo) {
        // Dispatch an event.
        if (args.length !== 1) return;

        // If the event is not in the event list, add it.
        if (!(args[0] in logo.eventList)) {
            var event = new Event(args[0]);
            logo.eventList[args[0]] = event;
        }
        logo.stage.dispatchEvent(args[0]);
    }
}
  ```

### An arg block:

  ```
    class XBlock extends ValueBlock {
    constructor() {
        //.TRANS: x coordinate
        super('x');
        this.setPalette('graphics');

        this.formBlock({
            name: this.lang === 'ja' ? _('x3') : _('x')
        });
    }

    arg(logo, turtle, blk) {
        if (logo.inStatusMatrix && logo.blocks.blockList[logo.blocks.blockList[blk].connections[0]].name === 'print') {
            logo.statusFields.push([blk, 'x']);
        } else {
            return logo.turtles.screenX2turtleX(logo.turtles.turtleList[turtle].container.x);
        }
    }
}
  ```

### A macro definiton:

  ```
    this.makeMacro((x, y) => [
            [0, 'settemperament', x, y, [null, 1, 2, 3, null]],
            [1, ['temperamentname', {'value': 'equal'}], 0, 0, [0]],
            [2, ['notename', {'value': 'C'}], 0, 0, [0]],
            [3, ['number', {'value': 4}], 0, 0, [0]]
        ]);
  ```

## Working with formBlock function

`formBlock` is a method of `BaseBlock`. This function takes a JSON-like object describing the visual appearance of the block, its arguments etc. The format of that object is as follows:

1. `name` : This specifies the display name on the block. Typically it is of the format  `_('...')`.

Note: If the `name` is omitted or is set to an empty string, a second argument of `false` should be passed to `formBlock` or else it will resize the block to fit the non-existent text.

2. `flows` :

      * `top` : Defines how top of the block should connect. Values: `true`, `false` or `cap`. `cap` is used for blocks like start, to produce the protruding spike.

      * `bottom` :  Defines how bottom of the block should connect. Values: `true`, `false` or `cap`. `tail` is used for blocks like start, to produce the protruding spike.

      * `left`: Defines how top of the block should connect. It's value is a boolean.

      * `type` : Defines the flow used by the block.

        Values:

        * `flow` : Flow blocks are most commonly used one.
        * `arg` : Mainly used for blocks like do and calculate.
        * `value`: Used for blocks such as number.
        * `null` : Indicates that it is just a plain block with nothing special.

      * `labels` : Defines the labels to be displayed for each flow branch. This list is also used to determine how many flows a block has. To mark an unlabelled flow use and empty string.

3. `args` : Defines the number of arguments the block takes.

4. `argTypes` : The type for each argument. Default type is `numberin`.

5. `argLabels` : A list of labels to be applied to arguments.

6. `defaults` : A list of default values for arguments.

e.g. Below definition shows the use of most of the above properties:
```
class MakeBlockBlock extends LeftBlock {
    constructor() {
        super('makeblock');
        this.setPalette('extras');

        this.formBlock({
            //.TRANS: Create a new block programmatically.
            name: _('make block'),
            args: 1,
	    argTypes: ['anyin'],
            outType: 'numberout',
            flows: {
                type: 'arg',
		types: ['anyin'],
		labels: ['']
            },
            defaults: [_('note')]
        });
    }
}

```

Note: The call to `formBlock` will attempt further call
`adjustWidthToLabel`. This behaviour by passing a false value as the
second argument. There is currently no way to define left-hand output
as a boolean. Though it can be done by passing a third option of
`bool` to `flows.left`

### Setting up listeners in clamp blocks

Clamp blocks are a bit complicated since they have interior flows and
need to trigger a listener when that flow completes its execution.

1. ChildFlow and ChildFlowCount

`childFlow = args[n + 1]`, where n is the number of arguments passed
to the blocks.

If there are no arguments, `childFlow = args[1]`. (Some blocks, such
as the *Start* block, do not have any external flow, so their
`childFlow = args[0]`.

2. Create a unique listener name

`var listenerName = '_listenername_' + turtle + '_' + blk;`

3. Assign the block that will dispatch the listener. _setDispatchBlock
will make this assignment for you (typically this is the block that
immediately follows the clamp block).

`that.setDispatchBlock(blk, turtle, listenerName);`

4. Create a listener event, where you typically clean up anything
associated with the clamp block's childFlow.

```
var __listener = function (event) {

};

```

## Using tone.js

[Tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js) is "a framework for
creating interactive music in the browser. It provides advanced
scheduling capabilities, synths and effects, and intuitive musical
abstractions built on top of the Web Audio API."

Music Blocks uses the Tone.js API for many of the synth effects, such
as chorus, vibrato and tremolo.

In order to set up a new synth effect:
1. Add necessary parameters into `paramsEffects` object in `logo.js`
2. Add a boolean variable that triggers the param effects in `__hasParamEffect` function in `logo.js`
3. Add effects by defining parameters values in `logo.js`
4. Modify synth in `synthutils.js` and make sure to `dispose` synth after your effect has run.

## Odds and ends

* You should add your new block to the rubrics found in
  [rubrics.js](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/blob/master/js/rubrics.js)

* As mentioned above, if you are adding user-facing strings, be sure
  to add them in this format: `_('string')` This allows the string to
  be set up for translation into other languages.

* Before processing the notes, you need to check if the argument is present
  of if the type of argument is correct, else, set `stopTurtle` to true.

* If you are changing the functionality of an existing block (adding a
  new arg, etc.) then you probably should mark the existing block as
  hidden and add a new block instead so as to not break existing
  projects that use the old block.

## Protoblock types

* `zeroArgBlock`: E.g., penup, pendown
* `basicBlockNoFlow`: E.g., break
* `oneArgBlock`: E.g., forward, right
* `twoArgBlock`: E.g., setxy. These are expandable.
* `oneArgMathBlock`: E.g., sqrt
* `oneArgMathWithLabelBlock`: E.g., box
* `twoArgMathBlock`: E.g., plus, minus, multiply, divide. These are also expandable.
* `valueBlock`: E.g., number, string. Value blocks get DOM textareas associated with them so their values can be edited by the user.
* `mediuniquenameBlock`: E.g., media. Media blocks invoke a chooser and a thumbnail image is overlayed to represent the data associated with the block.
* `flowClampZeroArgBlock`: E.g., start. A "child" flow is docked in an expandable clamp. There are no additional arguments and no flow above or below.
* `flowClampOneArgBlock`: E.g., repeat. Unlike action, there is a flow above and below.
* `flowClampBooleanArgBlock`: E.g., if.  A "child" flow is docked in an expandable clamp. The additional argument is a boolean. There is flow above and below.
* `doubleFlowClampBooleanArgBlock`: E.g., if then else.  Two "child" flows are docked in expandable clamps. The additional argument is a boolean. There is flow above and below.
* `blockClampZeroArgBlock`: E.g., forever. Unlike start, there is flow above and below.
* `blockClampOneArgBlock`: E.g., action. A "child" flow is docked in an expandable clamp. The additional argument is a name. Again, no flow above or below.
* `booleanZeroArgBlock`: E.g., mouse button.
* `booleanOneBooleanArgBlock`: E.g., not
* `booleanTwoBooleanArgBlock`: E.g., and
* `booleanOneArgBlock`: E.g., found mouse
* `booleanTwoArgBlock`: E.g., greater, less, equal.
* `parameterBlock`: E.g., color, shade, pensize

## FAQ

1. I want to take in a fraction as a single argument but it appears in
decimal with only one input field.

* You are probably missing the relevant parameters in `macro.js`. Take
  a look at other block examples and modify `macro.js` accordingly.

2. How do I get the information for the next note?

`var noteObj = getNote(note, octave, transposition, that.keySignature[turtle], that.movable[turtle], direction, that.errorMsg);`

3. How do I modify the pitch parameters, such as the octave or scalar transposition?
* To modify octave: `that.transposition[turtle] += transValue`
* To modify pitch: Take a look at the `addPitch` function
* To modify scalar transposition: `that.scalarTransposition[turtle] += transValue`
* To modify beat factor: `that.beatFactor[turtle] *= beatFactor`
* In some cases, you need to modify the beat factor accordingly with `bpm`

4. What are some useful functions?

There are many, but here are a few:
* `rationalToFraction`
* `addPitch`
* `lastNotePlayed`
* `pitchToFrequency`
* `pitchToNumber`
* `errorMsg`

## About the internal block format.

In `blocks.js` there is an instance variable, `blockList` that is a list of
the current set of blocks that Music Blocks knows about. There are
methods to add blocks to the list, notably `loadNewBlocks`. There is
even a block that can be used to create new blocks, enabling Music
Blocks programs to self-modify.

The internal format of this list is:

```
[block, block, block, ...]
```

Each block is itself a list of the form:

```
[block number, block name, x position, y position, [connection 0, connection 1...]]
```

where block number and the connections are integer indices into
`blockList`, block name is string that matches one of the blocks
defined in `basicblocks.js`, and the x and y positions are float value
screen coordinates.

For example, a *Note block* might look like this:

```
[[0, 'newnote', 100, 100, [null, 1, 4, null]],
 [1, 'divide', 0, 0, [0, 2, 3]],
 [2, ['number', {'value': 1}], 0, 0, [1]],
 [3, ['number', {'value': 4}], 0, 0, [1]],
 [4, 'vspace', 0, 0, [0, 5]],
 [5, 'pitch', 0, 0, [4, 6, 7, null]]
 [6, ['solfege', {'value': 'sol'}], 0, 0, [5]],
 [7, ['number', {'value': 4}], 0, 0, [5]],
]
```

The block names are the internal names, not the labels shown in the
interface. Hence *Note blocks* are `newnote` blocks.  Note that the
`newnote` block has 4 connections, two of which are null, since there
is no block connected above or below.  Also note that the only x, y
poaition that is relevant is that of the `newnote` block, since the
other blocks will be positioned by where they connect. (Typically, you
only need to worry about the position of the first block in a stack of
blocks. Everything else is calculated for you.)

![alt
 tag](https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/documentation/block-connections-diagram.svg
 "Blocks maintain a list of connections to other blocks.")

In the figure about and in the code example above, the `divide` block
connection 0 connects to the `newnote` block connection 1, etc.
