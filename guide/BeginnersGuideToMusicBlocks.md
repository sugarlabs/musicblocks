- - - - 
Music Blocks software is Free/Libre Software designed for teachers and learners to explore the fundamental concepts of music in a fun, scalable, and open-ended visual-coding environment.

You can watch the [video here](https://musicblocks.net/) to check out what Music Blocks is.

This is a beginner's Guide that introduces the very basics of Music Blocks and simple transformations.

## <a name="BasicKeywords"></a>A. Basic Keywords 

### <a name="Note"></a> 1. Note
The term note has three primary meanings:

  1. A sign used in musical notation to represent the relative duration and pitch of a sound (♪, ♫);
  
  2. A pitched sound itself.
  
  3. A pitch class.
  
Notes are the "atoms" of much written music: discretizations of musical phenomena that facilitate performance, comprehension, and analysis.

In traditional music theory, most countries in the world use the naming convention Do–Re–Mi–Fa–Sol–La–Si, but within the English-speaking 
and Dutch-speaking world, pitch classes are typically represented by the first seven letters of the Latin alphabet (A, B, C, D, E, F and G). 


### <a name="Pitch"></a>2. Pitch
Pitch of a note means how high or low a note is.

Not all musical instruments give notes of a particular pitch. Many percussion instruments like drums, triangles and cymbals are instruments used for rhythms.
They do not play tunes because they have no definite pitch


### <a name="Key"></a>3. Key
Key of a piece is a group of pitches, or scale upon which a music composition is created in classical, Western art, and Western pop music


### <a name="Chord"></a>4. Chord
A chord, in music, is any harmonic set of pitches consisting of two or more (usually three) notes (also called "pitches") that are heard as if sounding simultaneously.
In everyday use by musical ensembles such as bands and orchestras, the three or more notes of a chord are often sounded together.


### <a name="Tonerow"></a>5. Tone row
 Tone row or note row , also series and set, refers to a non-repetitive ordering of a set of pitch-classes,
 typically of the twelve notes in musical set theory of the chromatic scale, though both larger and smaller sets are sometimes found.


### <a name="Crescendo"></a>6. Crescendo  
A crescendo is a way for composers to indicate that a passage of music should gradually increase in loudness over time.


### <a name="Staccato"></a>7. Staccato 
Staccato is a form of musical articulation.
In modern notation it signifies a note of shortened duration, separated from the note that may follow by silence.


### <a name="Slur"></a>8. Slur  
A slur is a symbol in Western musical notation indicating that the notes it embraces are to be played without separation, i.e. with legato articulation.


### <a name="Voice"></a>9.Voice 
A voice type is a particular human singing voice identified as having certain qualities or characteristics of vocal range, vocal weight, tessitura,
vocal timbre, and vocal transition points (passaggio), such as breaks and lifts within the voice.


### <a name="Vibrato"></a>10. Vibrato
Vibrato is a musical effect consisting of a regular, pulsating change of pitch.
It is used to add expression to vocal and instrumental music.


## <a name="#MusicalTransformations"></a>B. Musical Transformations
- - - - 

In music, a transformation consists of any operation or process that may apply to a musical variable (usually a set or tone row in 
twelve tone music, or a melody or chord progression in tonal music) in composition, performance, or analysis. 
Transformations include multiplication, rotation, permutation (i.e. transposition, inversion, and retrograde), 
and combinations thereof.

### <a name="Sharps"></a> 1. Sharps And Flats
 A sharp will raise the pitch by one half step whereas a flat will lower by one half step
 
 
 ### <a name="Transpositions"></a> 2. Transpositions
 In music transposition refers to the process,
 or operation, of moving a collection of notes (pitches or pitch classes) up or down in pitch by a constant interval.
 
 For example, one might transpose an entire piece of music into another key.
 Similarly, one might transpose a tone row or an unordered collection of pitches such as a chord so that it begins on another pitch.


### <a name="DottedNotes"></a> 3. Dotted Notes 
dotted note is a note with a small dot written after it. In modern practice the first dot increases the duration of the basic note 
by half of its original value. 
A dotted note is equivalent to writing the basic note tied to a note of half the value; or with more than one dot, 
tied to notes of progressively halved value.

### <a name="Multiplication"></a> 4. Multiplication and division of beat value
A multiplicative operation is a mapping in which the argument is multiplied and divisive operation is a mapping in which argument is divided
thus, speeding up or slowing down the notes respectively.


### <a name="Repetition"></a>5. Repetition and duplication of notes 
Repetition is used to play a sequence of notes multiple times; duplication is used to repeat each note in a sequence.


### <a name="Volume"></a> 6. Set Volume, Crescendo, Staccato, and Slur
It involves setting the volume, crescendo, staccato, and slur os the notes.

### <a name="Inversion"></a>7. Inversion 
In music theory, the word inversion has several meanings. 
There are inverted chords, inverted melodies, inverted intervals, and (in counterpoint) inverted voices.

a)Intervals :- An interval is inverted by raising or lowering either of the notes using displacement of the octave (or octaves) so that both retain their names (pitch class). 
    For example, the inversion of an interval consisting of a C with an E above it is an E with a C above it - to work this out, the C may be moved up, the E may be lowered, or both may be moved.

b)Chord :- A chord's inversion describes the relationship of its bass to the other tones in the chord. For instance, a C major triad contains the tones C, E and G; its inversion is determined by which of these tones is the bottom note in the chord.



### <a name="Retrograde"></a>8. Retrograde
It is used to play the contained notes in reverse order.


### <a name="Setting"></a> 9. Setting voice and vibrato
It is used to select a voice for the synthesizer and add a rapid variation in pitch to any contained notes respectively.
