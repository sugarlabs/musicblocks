<p>Music Blocks is a programming environment for children interested in
music and graphics. It expands upon Turtle Blocks by adding a
collection of features relating to pitch and rhythm.</p>
<p>The Turtle Blocks guide is a good place to start learning about the
basics. In this guide, we illustrate the musical features by walking
the reader through numerous examples.</p>
<p>A short <a href="http://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/tree/master/Debugging.md">Guide to
Debugging</a>. is
also available.</p>

<p>Music Blocks is designed to run in a browser. Most of the development
has been done in Chrome, but it should also work in Firefox, Opera,
and some versions of Safari. You can run it from
<a href="https://musicblocks.sugarlabs.org">musicblocks.sugarlabs.org</a>, from
<a href="https://musicblocks.sugarlabs.org">github io</a>, or by
downloading a copy of the code and running a local copy directly from
the file system of your computer. (Note that when running locally, you
may have to use a local server to expose all of the features.)</p>
<p>This guide details the music-specific features of Music Blocks.  You
may also be interested in the <a href="http://github.com/sugarlabs/turtleblocksjs/tree/master/guide">Turtle Blocks
Guide</a>,
which reviews many programming features common to both projects.</p>

<p><a href="#GETTING-STARTED">Previous Section (1. Getting Started)</a> | <a href="#TOC">Back to
Table of Contents</a> | <a href="#PROGRAMMING-WITH-MUSIC">Next Section (3. Programming with
Music)</a></p>
<p>Music Blocks incorporates many common elements of music, such as
<a href="#PITCH">pitch</a>, <a href="#rhythms">rhythm</a>, <a href="#MORE-TRANSFORMATIONS">volume</a>,
and, to some degree, <a href="#VOICES">timbre and texture</a>.</p>
<h3 id="-a-name-note-value-a-2-1-note-value-blocks"><a name="NOTE-VALUE"></a>2.1 Note Value Blocks</h3>
<p>At the heart of Music Blocks is the <em>Note value</em> block. The <em>Note
value</em> block is a container for a <a href="#PITCH"><em>Pitch</em> block</a> that
specifies the duration (note value) of the pitch.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/note1.svg" alt="alt tag" title="A single Note value block (top) and two consecutive Note value blocks (bottom)"></p>
<p>At the top of the example above, a single (detached) <em>Note value</em>
block is shown. The <code>1/8</code> is value of the note, which is, in this
case, an eighth note.</p>
<p>At the bottom, two notes that are played consecutively are shown. They
are both <code>1/8</code> notes, making the duration of the entire sequence
<code>1/4</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/note2.svg" alt="alt tag" title="A quarter note, a sixteenth note, and a half note Note value blocks"></p>
<p>In this example, different note values are shown. From top to bottom,
they are: <code>1/4</code> for an quarter note, <code>1/16</code> for a sixteenth note, and
<code>1/2</code> for a half note.</p>
<p>Note that any mathematical operations can be used as input to the
<em>Note value</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/charts/NotationRestChart.svg" alt="alt
 tag" title="A chart of note values and their corresponding note value blocks" width="100%"></p>
<p>Please refer to the above picture for a visual representation of note
values.</p>
<h3 id="-a-name-pitch-a-2-2-pitch-blocks"><a name="PITCH"></a>2.2 Pitch Blocks</h3>
<p>As we have seen, <em>Pitch</em> blocks are used inside the
<a href="#NOTE-VALUE"><em>Note value</em></a> blocks. The <em>Pitch</em> block specifies the
pitch name and pitch octave of a note that in combination determines
the frequency (and therefore pitch) at which the note is played.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/note3.svg" alt="alt tag" title="Specifying a pitch block&#39;s name and octave"></p>
<p>There are many systems you can use to specify a <em>pitch</em> block&#39;s name
and octave. Some examples are shown above.</p>
<p>The top <em>Pitch</em> block is specified using a <em>Solfege</em> block (<code>Sol</code> in
<code>Octave 4</code>), which contains the notes <code>Do Re Me Fa Sol La Ti</code>.</p>
<p>The pitch of the next block is specified using a <em>Pitch-name</em> block
(<code>G</code> in <code>Octave 4</code>), which contains the notes <code>C D E F G A B</code>.</p>
<p>The next block is specified using a <em>Scale-degree</em> block (the <code>5th note</code>
in the scale, &#39;G&#39;, also in &#39;Octave 4&#39;), <code>C == 1, D == 2, ...</code></p>
<p>The next block is specified using a <em>Pitch-number</em> block (the <code>7th
semi-tone</code> above <code>C</code> in <code>Octave 4</code>). The offset for the pitch number
can be modified using the <em>Set-pitch-number-offset</em> block.</p>
<p>The pitch of the next block is specified using the <em>Hertz</em> block in
conjunction with a <em>Number</em> block (<code>392</code> Hertz) , which corresponds to
the frequency of the sound made.</p>
<p>The octave is specified using a number block and is restricted to
whole numbers. In the case where the pitch name is specified by
frequency, the octave is ignored.The octave argument can also be specified using a <em>Text</em> block with values <em>current</em>, <em>previous</em>, <em>next</em> which does as 0, -1, 1 respectively.</p>
<p>The octave of the next block is specified using a <em>current</em> text block (<code>Sol</code> in <code>Octave 4</code>).</p>
<p>The octave of the next block is specified using a <em>previous</em> text block (<code>G</code> in <code>Octave 3</code>).</p>
<p>The octave of the last block is specified using a <em>next</em> text block (<code>G</code> in <code>Octave 5</code>).</p>
<p>Note that the pitch name can also be specified using a <em>Text</em> block. </p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/charts/KeyboardChart.svg" alt="alt tag" title="Note layout chart for keyboard" width="100%"></p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/charts/MalletChart.svg" alt="alt tag" title="Note layout chart for mallet" width="100%"></p>
<p>Please refer to the above charts for a visual representation of where
notes are located on a keyboard or staff.</p>
<h3 id="-a-name-chords-a-2-3-chords"><a name="CHORDS"></a>2.3 Chords</h3>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/note4.svg" alt="alt tag" title="Forming a chord"></p>
<p>A chord (multiple, simultaneous pitches) can be specified by adding
multiple <em>Pitch</em> blocks into a single <em>Note value</em> block, like the
above example.</p>
<h3 id="-a-name-rests-a-2-4-rests"><a name="RESTS"></a>2.4 Rests</h3>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/silence.svg" alt="alt tag" title="Silence blocks create rests"></p>
<p>A rest of the specified note value duration can be constructed using a
<em>Silence</em> block in place of a <em>Pitch</em> block.</p>
<h3 id="-a-name-drums-a-2-5-drums"><a name="DRUMS"></a>2.5 Drums</h3>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/drum1.svg" alt="alt tag" title="Using Drum Sample block"></p>
<p>Anywhere a <em>Pitch</em> block can be used&mdash;e.g., inside of the matrix
or a <em>Note value</em> block&mdash;a <em>Drum Sample</em> block can also be used
instead. Currently there about two dozen different samples from which
to choose. The default drum is a kick drum.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/note5.svg" alt="alt tag" title="Multiple Drum Sample blocks in combinations"></p>
<p>Just as in the <a href="#CHORD">chord</a> example above, you can use multiple
<em>Drum</em> blocks within a single <em>Note value</em> blocks, and combine them
with <em>Pitch</em> blocks as well.</p>
<h2 id="-a-name-programming-with-music-a-3-programming-with-music"><a name="PROGRAMMING-WITH-MUSIC"></a>3. Programming with Music</h2>
<p><a href="#NOTES">Previous Section (2. Making Sounds)</a> | <a href="#TOC">Back to Table of Contents</a> | <a href="#WIDGETS">Next Section (4. Widgets)</a></p>
<p>This section of the guide discusses how to use chunks of notes to
program music. Note that you can program with chunks you create by
hand or use the <a href="#pitch-time"><em>Pitch-time Matrix</em></a> widget to help you
get started.</p>
<h3 id="-a-name-chunks-a-3-1-chunks"><a name="CHUNKS"></a>3.1 Chunks</h3>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix4.svg" alt="alt tag" title="working of action stack"></p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/chunk1.svg" alt="alt tag" title="using chunk inside Start block"></p>
<p>Every time you create a new <em>Action</em> stack, Music Blocks creates a new
block specific to, and linked with, that stack. (The new block is
found at the top of the <em>Block</em> palette, found on the left edge of the
screen.) Clicking on and running this block is the same as clicking on
your stack. By default, the new blocks are named <code>chunk</code>, <code>chunk1</code>,
<code>chunk2</code>... but you can rename them by editing the labels on the
<em>Action</em> blocks.</p>
<p>An <em>Action</em> block contains a sequence of actions that will only be
executed when the block is referred to by something else, such as a
start block. This is useful in orchestrating more complex programs of
music.</p>
<p>A <em>Start</em> Block is a <em>chunk</em> that will automatically be executed once
the start button is pressed.  This is where most of your programs will
begin at.  There are many ways to <em>Run</em> a program: you can click on
the <em>Run</em> button at the upper-left corner of the screen to run the
music at a fast speed; a long press on the <em>Run</em> button will run it
slower (useful for debugging); and the <em>Step</em> button can be used to
step through the program one block per button press. (An extra-long
press of the <em>Run</em> button will play back the music slowly. A long
press of the <em>Step</em> button will step through the program note by
note.)</p>
<p>In the example above, the <em>Chunk</em> block is inside of a <em>Start</em> block,
which means that when any of the start buttons is pressed, the code
inside the <em>Start</em> block (the <em>Chunk</em> block) will be executed. You can
add more chunks after this one inside the <em>Start</em> block to execute
them sequentially.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/chunk2.svg" alt="alt tag" title="usage of multiple Chunk blocks"></p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/chunk3.svg" alt="alt tag" title="usage of Repeat block"></p>
<p>You can <a href="#REPETITION">repeat</a> chunks either by using multiple <em>Chunk</em> blocks or using a
<em>Repeat</em> block.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/chunk4.svg" alt="alt tag" title="multiple action stacks"></p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/chunk5.svg" alt="alt tag" title="mixing and matching chunks"></p>
<p>You can also mix and match chunks. Here we play the action block with
name <code>chunk0</code>, followed by <code>chunk1</code> twice, and then <code>chunk0</code> again.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/chunk6.svg" alt="alt tag" title="creating a song using chunks"></p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/chunk7.svg" alt="alt tag" title="usage of Repeat block in a song"></p>
<p>A few more chunks and we can make a song. (Can you read the block
notation well enough to guess the outcome? Are you familiar with the
song we created?)</p>
<h3 id="-a-name-transformation-a-3-2-musical-transformations"><a name="TRANSFORMATION"></a>3.2 Musical Transformations</h3>
<p>There are many ways to transform pitch, rhythm, and other sonic qualities.</p>
<h4 id="-a-name-step-pitch-a-3-2-1-step-pitch-block"><a name="STEP-PITCH"></a>3.2.1 Step Pitch Block</h4>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/transform0.svg" alt="alt tag" title="Using the Step Pitch block"></p>
<p>The <em>Step Pitch</em> block will move up or down notes in a scale from the
last played note. In the example above, <em>Step Pitch</em> blocks are used
inside of <em>Repeat</em> blocks to repeat the code <code>7</code> times, playing up and
down a scale.</p>
<p><a href="https://musicblocks.sugarlabs.org/index.html?id=1523032034365533&amp;run=True">RUN LIVE</a></p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/transform16.svg" alt="alt tag" title="Using the Scalar Step Up and Down blocks"></p>
<p>Another way to move up and down notes in a scale is to use the <em>Scalar
Step Up</em> and <em>Scalar Step Down</em> blocks. These blocks calculate the
number of half-steps to the next note in the current mode. (You can
read more about <a href="#modes">Musical Modes</a> below.) Note that the <em>Mouse
Pitch Number</em> block returns the pitch number of the most recent note
played.</p>
<p>In this example, we are using the <em>Mode length</em> block, which returns
the number of scalar steps in the current mode (7 for Major and Minor
modes).</p>
<h4 id="-a-name-sharps-and-flats-a-3-2-2-sharps-and-flats"><a name="SHARPS-AND-FLATS"></a>3.2.2 Sharps And Flats</h4>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/transform1.svg" alt="alt tag" title="Using Sharp and Flat blocks"></p>
<p>The <em>Accidental</em> block can be wrapped around <em>Pitch</em> blocks, <em>Note
value</em> blocks, or <a href="#CHUNKS">chunks</a>. A sharp will raise the pitch by
one half step. A flat will lower by one half step. In the example, on
the left, just the <em>Pitch</em> block <code>Mi</code> is lowered by one half step; on
the right, both <em>Pitch</em> blocks are raised by one half step. (You can
also use a double-sharp or double-flat accidental.)</p>
<h4 id="-a-name-adjust-transposition-a-3-2-3-adjusting-transposition"><a name="ADJUST-TRANSPOSITION"></a>3.2.3 Adjusting Transposition</h4>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/transform2.svg" alt="alt tag" title="Adjusting transpositions"></p>
<p>There are several ways to transpose a pitch: by semi-tone or scalar
steps. The <em>Semi-tone-transposition</em> block (above left) can be used to
make larger shifts in pitch in half-step units. A positive number
shifts the pitch up and a negative number shifts the pitch down. The
input must be a whole number. To shift up an entire octave, transpose
by <code>12</code> half-steps. <code>-12</code> will shift down an entire octave.</p>
<p>The <em>Scalar-transposition</em> block (above right) shifts a pitch based on
the current key and mode. For example, in <code>C Major</code>, a scalar
transposition of <code>1</code> would transpose <code>C</code> to <code>D</code> (even though it is a
transposition of <code>2</code> half steps). To transpose <code>E</code> to <code>F</code> is <code>1</code>
scalar step (or <code>1</code> half step). To shift an entire octave, scalar
transpose by the mode length up or down. (In major scales, the mode
length is <code>7</code>.)</p>
<p>As a convenience, a number of standard scalar transpositions are
provided: <em>Unison</em>, <em>Second</em>, <em>Third</em>, ..., <em>Seventh</em>, <em>Down third</em>,
and <em>Down sixth</em>, as well as a transposition for <em>Octave</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/transform3.svg" alt="alt tag" title="raising an octave using semi-tone-transposition"></p>
<p>In the example above, we take the song we programmed previously and
raise it by one octave.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/transform18.svg" alt="alt tag" title="The Register block"></p>
<p>The <em>Register</em> block provides an easy way to modify the register
(octave) of the notes that follow it. In the example above it is first
used to bump the <code>Mi 4</code> note up by one octave and then to bump the
<code>Sol 4</code> note down by one octave.</p>
<h4 id="-a-name-dotted-a-3-2-4-dotted-notes"><a name="DOTTED"></a>3.2.4 Dotted Notes</h4>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/transform4.svg" alt="alt tag" title="Creating dotted notes using the Dot block"></p>
<p>You can &quot;dot&quot; notes using the <em>Dot</em> block. A dotted note extends the
rhythmic duration of a note by 50%. E.g., a dotted quarter note will
play for <code>3/8</code> <code>(i.e. 1/4 + 1/8)</code> of a beat. A dotted eighth note will
play for <code>3/16</code> <code>(i.e. 1/8 + 1/16)</code> of a beat. A double dot extends
the duration by <code>75%</code> <code>(i.e. 50% + [50% of 50%])</code>. For example, a
double-dotted quarter note will play for <code>7/16</code> <code>(i.e. 1/4 + 1/8 +
1/16)</code> of a beat (which is the same as <code>4/16 + 2/16 + 1/16 = 7/16</code>).</p>
<p>The dot block is useful as an expression of musical rhythm--it is
convenient and helps to organize musical ideas (e.g. many melodies use
dots as the basis of their rhythmic motifs), however you can achieve
the same rhythmic result as dot by putting the calculation directly
into note value as well. For example, indicating <code>3/8</code> instead of
<code>1/4</code> will result in a dotted quarter note.</p>
<p>The chart below shows two common examples, dotted quarter and dotted
eighth, and how to achieve them with either the dot block or by direct
calculation into a note&#39;s note value.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgit.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/charts/DotsChart.svg" alt="alt tag" title="using dotted notes"></p>
<h4 id="-a-name-multiply-and-divide-a-3-2-5-changing-note-s-duration-via-mathematical-operations"><a name="MULTIPLY-AND-DIVIDE"></a>3.2.5 Changing Note(s) duration via Mathematical Operations</h4>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/transform5.svg" alt="alt tag" title="Changing note duration for a note or notes"></p>
<p>You can also multiply (or divide) the note value, which will change
the duration of the notes by changing their note values. Multiplying
the note value of an <code>1/8</code> note by <code>1/2</code> is the equivalent of playing
a <code>1/16</code> note (i.e. <code>1/2 * 1/8 = 1/16</code>) . Multiplying the note value
of an <code>1/8</code> note by <code>2/1</code> (which has the effect of dividing by <code>1/2</code>)
will result in the equivalent of a <code>1/4</code> note.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/drum4.svg" alt="alt tag" title="increasing sequence of drum beats over time"></p>
<p>In the above example, the sequence of <a href="#DRUMS">drum</a> note values is
decreased over time, at each repetition.</p>
<p><a href="https://musicblocks.sugarlabs.org/index.html?id=1523106271018484&amp;run=True">RUN LIVE</a></p>
<h4 id="-a-name-repetition-a-3-2-6-repeating-notes"><a name="REPETITION"></a>3.2.6 Repeating Notes</h4>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/transform6.svg" alt="alt tag" title="repeating notes"></p>
<p>There are several ways to repeat notes. The <em>Repeat</em> block will play a
sequence of notes multiple times; the <em>Duplicate</em> block will repeat each
note in a sequence.</p>
<p>In the example, on the left, the result would be <code>Sol, Re, Sol, Sol,
Re, Sol, Sol, Re, Sol, Sol, Re, Sol</code>; on the right the result would be
<code>Sol, Sol, Sol, Sol, Re, Re, Re, Re, Sol, Sol, Sol, Sol</code>.</p>
<h4 id="-a-name-swinging-a-3-2-7-swinging-notes-and-tied-notes"><a name="SWINGING"></a>3.2.7 Swinging Notes and Tied Notes</h4>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/transform7.svg" alt="alt tag" title="swinging notes and tied notes"></p>
<p>The <em>Swing</em> block works on pairs of notes (specified by note value),
adding some duration (specified by swing value) to the first note and
taking the same amount from the second note. Notes that do not match
note value are unchanged.</p>
<p>In the example, <code>re5</code> would be played as a <code>1/6</code> note and <code>mi5</code> would
be played as a <code>1/12</code> note (<code>1/8 + 1/24 === 1/6</code> and <code>1/8 - 1/24 ===
1/12</code>). Observe that the total duration of the pair of notes is
unchanged.</p>
<p>Tie also works on pairs of notes, combining them into one note. (The
notes must be identical in pitch, but can vary in rhythm.)</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgit.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/charts/TiesChart.svg" alt="alt tag" title="using notes with ties"></p>
<h4 id="-a-name-more-transformations-a-3-2-8-set-volume-crescendo-staccato-and-slur"><a name="MORE-TRANSFORMATIONS"></a>3.2.8 Set Volume, Crescendo, Staccato, and Slur</h4>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/transform8.svg" alt="alt tag" title="Set master volume, set synth volume, set relative volume, crescendo"></p>
<p>The <em>Set master volume</em> block will change the master volume. The
default is <code>50</code>; the range is <code>0</code> (silence) to <code>100</code> (full volume).</p>
<p>The <em>Set synth volume</em> block will change the volume of a particular
synth, e.g., <code>violin</code>, <code>snare drum</code>, etc. The default volume is <code>50</code>;
the range is <code>0</code> (silence) to <code>100</code> (full volume). In the example, the
<em>synth name</em> block is used to select the current synth.</p>
<p>As a convenience, a number of standard volume blocks are provided:
from loudest to quietest, there is <em>fff</em>, <em>ff</em> <em>f</em>, <em>mf</em>, <em>mp</em>, <em>p</em>,
<em>pp</em>, and <em>ppp</em>. In musical terms &quot;f&quot; means &quot;forte&quot; or loud, &quot;p&quot; means
&quot;piano&quot; or soft, and &quot;m&quot; means &quot;mezzo&quot; or middle.</p>
<p>The <em>Set Relative Volume</em> block modifies the clamped note&#39;s volume
according to the input value of the block in an added (or subtracted
when negative) percentage with respect to the original volume. For
example, <code>100</code> would mean doubling the current volume.</p>
<p>The <em>Crescendo</em> block will increase (or decrease) the volume of the
contained notes by a specified amount for every note played. For
example, if you have 3 notes in sequence contained in a <em>Crescendo</em>
block with a value of <code>5</code>, the final note will be at 15% more 
than the original value for volume.</p>
<p>NOTE: The <em>Crescendo</em> block does not alter the volume of a note as it is being played. Music Blocks does not yet have this functionality.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/transform17.svg" alt="alt tag" title="Staccato, and Slur blocks"></p>
<p>The <em>Staccato</em> block shortens the length of the actual
note&mdash;making them tighter bursts&mdash;while maintaining the
specified rhythmic value of the notes.</p>
<p>The <em>Slur</em> block lengthens the sustain of notes&mdash;running longer than
the noted duration and blending it into the next note&mdash;while
maintaining the specified rhythmic value of the notes.</p>
<h4 id="-a-name-intervals-a-3-2-9-intervals"><a name="INTERVALS"></a>3.2.9 Intervals</h4>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/transform9.svg" alt="alt tag" title="Scalar interval block"></p>
<p>The <em>Scalar interval</em> block calculates a relative interval based on
the current mode, skipping all notes outside of the mode. For example,
a <em>fifth</em>, and adds the additional pitches to a note&#39;s playback. In
the figure, we add <code>La</code> to <code>Re</code> and <code>Ti</code> to <code>Mi</code>.</p>
<p>As a convenience, a number of standard scalar intervals are provided
on the <em>Intervals</em> palette: <em>Unison</em>, <em>Second</em>, <em>Third</em>, ...,
<em>Seventh</em>, <em>Down third</em>, and <em>Down sixth</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>Scalar interval measure</em> block can be used to measure the number
of scalar steps between two pitched.</p>
<h4 id="-a-name-absolute-intervals-a-absolute-intervals"><a name= "ABSOLUTE-INTERVALS"></a>Absolute Intervals</h4>
<p>Absolute (or semi-tone) intervals are based on half-steps.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/transform14.svg" alt="alt tag" title="Using absolute intervals"></p>
<p>The <em>Augmented</em> block calculates an absolute interval (in half-steps),
e.g., an augmented fifth, and adds the additional pitches to a
note. Similarly, the <em>Minor</em> block calculates an absolute interval,
e.g., a minor third. Other absolute intervals include <em>Perfect</em>,
<em>Diminished</em>, and <em>Major</em>.</p>
<p>In the augmented fifth example above, a chord of <code>D5</code> and <code>A5</code> are
played, followed by a chord of <code>E5</code> and <code>C5</code>. In the minor third
example, which includes a shift of one octave, first a chord of <code>D5</code>
and <code>F5</code> is played, followed by chord of <code>E5</code> and <code>G6</code>.</p>
<p>As a convenience, a number of standard absolute intervals are provided
on the <em>Intervals</em> palette: <em>Major 2</em>, <em>Minor 3</em>, <em>Perfect 4</em>,
<em>Augmented 6</em>, <em>Diminished 8</em>, et al.</p>
<p>The <em>Doubly</em> block can be used to create a double augmentation or
double diminishment.</p>
<p>The <em>Semi-tone interval measure</em> block can be used to measure the
number of half-steps between two pitched.</p>
<h4 id="-a-name-inversion-a-3-2-11-inversion"><a name= "INVERSION"></a>3.2.11 Inversion</h4>
<p>The <em>Invert</em> block will rotate a series of notes around a target
note. There are three different modes of the <em>Invert</em> block: <em>even</em>,
<em>odd</em>, and <em>scalar</em>. In <em>even</em> and <em>odd</em> modes, the rotation is based
on half-steps. In <em>even</em> and <em>scalar</em> mode, the point of rotation is
the given note. In <em>odd</em> mode, the point of rotation is shifted up by
a <code>1/4</code> step, enabling rotation around a point between two notes. In
&quot;scalar&quot; mode, the scalar interval is preserved around the point of
rotation.</p>

<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/transform12.svg" alt="alt tag" title="setting voice and keys using Set Voice block"></p>
<p>The <em>Set Voice</em> block selects a <a href="#VOICES">voice</a> for the synthesizer for any
contained blocks, e.g., violin or cello.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/transform10.svg" alt="alt tag" title="Set Key block"></p>
<p>The <em>Set Key</em> block will change the key and mode of the mapping
between solfege, e.g., <code>Do</code>, <code>Re</code>, <code>Mi</code>, to note names, e.g., <code>C</code>,
<code>D</code>, <code>E</code>, when in C Major. Modes include Major and Minor, Chromatic,
and a number of more exotic modes, such as Bebop, Geez, Maqam, etc. 
This block allows users to access &quot;movable Do&quot; within Music
Blocks, where the mapping of solfege to particular pitch changes
depending on the user&#39;s specified tonality.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/transform19.svg" alt="alt tag" title="Define mode block"></p>
<p>The <em>Define mode</em> block can be used to define a custom mode by
defining the number and size of the steps within an octave. You can
use your custom mode with the <em>Set key</em> block.</p>
<h4 id="-a-name-vibrato-a-3-2-14-vibrato-tremelo-et-al-"><a name="VIBRATO"></a>3.2.14 Vibrato, Tremelo, et al.</h4>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/transform15.svg" alt="alt tag" title="Vibrato, tremelo, chorus, distortion, neighbor, and phaser blocks"></p>
<p>The <em>Vibrato</em> Block adds a rapid variation in pitch to any contained
notes. The intensity of the variation ranges from <code>1</code> to <code>100</code> (cents),
e.g. plus or minus up to one half step. The rate argument determines
the rate of the variation.</p>
<p>The other effects blocks also modulate pitch over time. Give them a try.</p>
<h3 id="-a-name-voices-a-3-3-voices"><a name="VOICES"></a>3.3 Voices</h3>
<p>Each <em>Start</em> block runs as a separate voice in Music Blocks. (When

<p>An alternative to use a preprogrammed delay is to use the <em>Broadcast</em>
block to bring in multiple voices. In the example above, after each
section of the song is played, a new event is broadcasted, bringing in
a new voice. Note the use of the <em>Mouse Sync</em> block. This ensures that
the multiple voices are synced to the same master clock.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/drum3.svg" alt="alt tag" title="usage of kick drum"></p>
<p>A special <em>Start drum</em> version of the <em>Start</em> block is available for laying
down a drum track. Any <em>Pitch</em> blocks encounted while starting from a
drum will be played as <code>C2</code> with the default drum sample. In the
example above, all of the notes in <code>chunk</code> will be played with a kick
drum.</p>

<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/graphics2.svg" alt="alt tag" title="color range"></p>
<p>Turtle graphics can be combined with the music blocks. By placing
graphics blocks, e.g., <em>Forward</em> and <em>Right</em>, inside of <em>Note value</em>
blocks, the graphics stay in sync with the music. In this example, the
turtle moves forward each time a quarter note is played. It turns
right during the eighth note. The pitch is raised by one half step,
the pen size decreases, and the pen color increases at each step in
the inner repeat loop.</p>

<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/fibonacci3.svg" alt="alt tag" title="usage of No-clock block"></p>
<p>In this example, because the computation and graphics are more
complex, a <em>No-clock</em> block is used to decouple the graphics from the
master clock. The &quot;No-clock* block prioritizes the sequence of
actions over the specified rhythm.</p>

<h3 id="-a-name-beat-a-3-5-beat"><a name="BEAT"></a>3.5 Beat</h3>
<p>The beat of the music is determined by the <em>Meter</em> block (by default,
it is set to 4:4).</p>
<p>The <em>Pickup</em> block can be used to accommodate any notes that come in
before the beat.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/beat1.svg" alt="alt tag" title="meter and pickup"></p>
<p>Specifying beat is useful in that you can have the character of a note
vary depending upon the beat. In the example below, the volume of
notes on Beat <code>1</code> and Beat <code>3</code> are increased, while the volume of off
beats is decreased.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/beat2.svg" alt="alt tag" title="on-beat-do"></p>
<p>The <em>On-Beat-Do</em> and <em>Off-Beat-Do</em> blocks let you specify actions to
take on specific beats. (Note that the action is run before any blocks
inside the note block associated with the beat are run.)</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/graphics5.svg" alt="alt tag" title="using beat to synchronize graphics"></p>
<p>Another approach to graphics is to use modulate them based on the
beat. In the example above, we call the same graphics action for each
note, but the parameters associated with the action, such as pen
width, are dependent upon which beat we are on. On Beat 1, the pen
size is set to <code>50</code> and the volume to <code>75</code>. On Beat <code>3</code>, the pen size is set
to <code>25</code> and the volume to <code>50</code>. On off beats, the pen size is set to <code>5</code> and
the volumne to <code>5</code>. The resultant graphic is shown below.</p>

<h3 id="-a-name-interactions-a-3-6-interactions"><a name="INTERACTIONS"></a>3.6 Interactions</h3>
<p>There are many ways to interactive with Music Blocks, including
tracking the mouse position to impact some aspect of the music.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/interactive.svg" alt="alt tag" title="interactions"></p>
<p>For example, we can launch the phrases (chunks) interactively. We use
the mouse position to generate a suffix: <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, or <code>3</code>,
depending on the quadrant. When the mouse is in the lower-left
quadrant, <code>chunk0</code> is played; lower-right quadrant, <code>chunk1</code>;
upper-left quadrant, <code>chunk2</code>; and upper-right quadrant, <code>chunk3</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/interactive3.svg" alt="alt tag" title="adding randomness to your music"></p>
<p>You can also add a bit of randomness to your music. In the top example
above, the <em>One-of</em> block is used to randomly assign either <code>Do</code> or
<code>Re</code> each time the <em>Note value</em> block is played. In the bottom example
above, the <em>One-of</em> block is used to randomly select between <code>chunk1</code>
and <code>chunk2</code>.</p>

<p>Musical Paint has been a popular activity dating back to programs such
as Dan Franzblau's <em>Vidsizer</em>(1979) or Morwaread Farbood's
*Hyperscore</em>(2002). Music Blocks can be used to create musical paint
as well. In the somewhat ambitious example below, we go a step further
than the typical paint program in that you can not only paint music (a
la Vidsizer) and playback your painting as a composition (a la
Hyperscore), but also generate <em>Note</em>blocks from your composition.</p>

<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/hyperscore.svg"
alt="alt tag" title="musical paint"></p>

<p>The program works by first creating an array from the heap that
corresponds to a 20x12 grid of notes on the screen: 20 columns,
representing time from left to right; and 12 rows, corresponding to
scalar pitch values, which increase in value from the bottom to the
top.</p>

<p>The <em>record</em>action repeatedly calls the <em>paint</em>action
until the *playback</em>button is clicked.</p>

<p>The <em>paint</em>action tracks the mouse (<em>Set
XY</em>to <em>cursor x</em>and <em>cursor y</em>) and, if the mouse
button is pressed, marks an entry in the array corresponding to that
note, plays the note, and leaves behind a "drop of paint".</p>

<p>The <em>playback</em>action is invoked by clicking on
the <em>play</em>mouse, which sets <em>recording</em>to `0`, thus
breaking out of the paint "while loop". Playback scans each column in
the array from left to right for pitches to play and generates a chord
of pitches for each column.</p>

<p>Once the <em>playback</em>action is complete,
the <em>save</em>action is invoked. Again each column in the array is
scanned, but this time, instead of playing notes, the <em>Make
Block</em>block is called in order to generate a stack of notes that
correspond to the composition. This stack can be copied and pasted
into another composition.</p>

<p>While a bit fanciful, this example, which can be run by clicking on
the link below, takes musical paint in a novel direction.</p>

displayed. Also, each note is displayed as it is played. There is one
row per voice in the status table.</p>
<p>Additional <em>Print</em> blocks can be added to the <em>Status</em> widget to
display additional music factors, e.g., duplicate, transposition,
skip, <a href="#MORE-TRANSFORMATIONS">staccato</a>,
<a href="#MORE-TRANSFORMATIONS">slur</a>, and <a href="#GRAPHICS">graphics</a> factors,
e.g., x, y, heading, color, shade, grey, and pensize.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/status3.svg" alt="alt tag" title="additional programming within the Status block"></p>

<h4 id="-a-name-pitch-time-a-4-2-1-the-pitch-time-matrix"><a name="pitch-time"></a>4.2.1 The Pitch-Time Matrix</h4>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix1.svg" alt="alt tag" title="Pitch-time Matrix"></p>
<p>Music Blocks provides a widget, the <em>Pitch-time Matrix</em>, as a scaffold
for getting started.</p>
<p>Once you&#39;ve launched Music Blocks in your browser, start by clicking
on the <em>Pitch-time Matrix</em> stack that appears in the middle of the
screen. (For the moment, ignore the <em>Start</em> block.) You&#39;ll see a grid
organized vertically by pitch and horizontally by rhythm.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix2.svg" alt="alt tag" title="Pitch and Rhythm block matrix"></p>
<p>The matrix in the figure above has three <em>Pitch</em> blocks and one
<em>Rhythm</em> block, which is used to create a 3 x 3 grid of pitch and
time.</p>
<p>Note that the default matrix has five <em>Pitch</em> blocks, one <em>Drum</em>
block, and two <em>Mouse</em> (movement) blocks. Hence, you will see eight
rows, one for each pitch, drum, and mouse (movement). (A ninth row at
the bottom is used for specifying the rhythms associated with each
note.) Also by default, there are two <em>Rhythm</em> blocks, which specifies
six quarter <code>(1/4)</code> notes followed by one half <code>(1/2)</code> note.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix3.svg" alt="alt tag" title="matrix"></p>
<p>By clicking on individual cells in the grid, you should hear
individual notes (or chords if you click on more than one cell in a
column). In the figure, three quarter notes are selected (black
cells). First <code>Re 4</code>, followed by <code>Mi 4</code>, followed by <code>Sol 4</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/header-icons/play-button.svg" alt="alt tag" title="play button"></p>
<p>If you click on the <em>Play</em> button (found in the top row of the grid),
you will hear a sequence of notes played (from left to right): <code>Re 4</code>,
<code>Mi 4</code>, <code>Sol 4</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/header-icons/export-chunk.svg" alt="alt tag" title="save button"></p>
<p>Once you have a group of notes (a &quot;chunk&quot;) that you like, click on the
<em>Save</em> button (just to the right of the <em>Play</em> button). This will
create a stack of blocks that can used to play these same notes
programmatically. (More on that below.)</p>
<p>You can rearrange the selected notes in the grid and save other chunks
as well.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/header-icons/sort.svg" alt="alt tag" title="sort button"></p>
<p>The <em>Sort</em> button will reorder the pitches in the matrix from highest
to lowest and eliminate any duplicate <em>Pitch</em> blocks.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/header-icons/erase-button.svg" alt="alt tag" title="erase button"></p>
<p>There is also an Erase button that will clear the grid.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t worry. You can reopen the matrix at anytime (it will remember
its previous state) and since you can define as many chunks as you
want, feel free to experiment.</p>
<p>Tip: You can put a chunk inside a <em>Pitch-time Matrix</em> block to generate
the matrix to corresponds to that chunk.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix4.svg" alt="alt tag" title="usage of octave for a pitch"></p>
<p>The chunk created when you click on the matrix is a stack of
blocks. The blocks are nested: an <em>Action</em> block contains three <em>Note
value</em> blocks, each of which contains a <em>Pitch</em> block. The <em>Action</em>
block has a name automatically generated by the matrix, in this case,
chunk. (You can rename the action by clicking on the name.). Each note
has a duration (in this case 4, which represents a quarter note). Try
putting different numbers in and see (hear) what happens. Each note
block also has a pitch block (if it were a chord, there would be
multiple <em>Pitch</em> blocks nested inside the Note block&#39;s clamp). Each
pitch block has a pitch name (<code>Re</code>, <code>Mi</code>, and <code>Sol</code>), and a pitch
octave; in this example, the octave is 4 for each pitch. (Try changing
the pitch names and the pitch octaves.)</p>
<p>To play the chuck, simply click on the action block (on the word
action). You should hear the notes play, ordered from top to bottom.</p>
<h4 id="-a-name-the-rhythm-block-a-4-2-2-the-rhythm-block"><a name="THE-RHYTHM-BLOCK"></a>4.2.2 The Rhythm Block</h4>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix6.svg" alt="alt tag" title="the Rhythm block"></p>
<p><em>Rhythm</em> blocks are used to generate rhythm patterns in the
<em>Pitch-time Matrix</em> block. The top argument to the <em>Rhythm</em> block
is the number of notes. The bottom argument is the duration of the
note. In the top example above, three columns for quarter notes
would be generated in the matrix. In the middle example, one column
for an eighth note would be generated. In the bottom example, seven
columns for 16th notes would be generated.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix7.svg" alt="alt tag" title="usage of Rhythm block"></p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix8.svg" alt="alt tag" title="resulting notes in tabular format"></p>
<p>You can use as many <em>Rhythm</em> blocks as you&#39;d like inside the
<em>Pitch-time Matrix</em> block. In the above example, two <em>Rhythm</em>
blocks are used, resulting in three quarter notes and six eighth
notes.</p>
<h4 id="-a-name-creating-tuplets-a-4-2-3-creating-tuplets"><a name="CREATING-TUPLETS"></a>4.2.3 Creating Tuplets</h4>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix9.svg" alt="alt tag" title="simple tuplet"></p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix10.svg" alt="alt tag" title="tuplet and rhythmic note values"></p>
<p>Tuplets are a collection of notes that get scaled to a specific
duration. Using tuplets makes it easy to create groups of notes that
are not based on a power of 2.</p>
<p>In the example above, three quarter notes&mdash;defined in the <em>Simple
Tuplet</em> block&mdash;are played in the time of a single quarter
note. The result is three twelfth notes. (This form, which is quite
common in music, is called a <em>triplet</em>. Other common tuplets include a
<em>quintuplet</em> and a <em>septuplet</em>.)</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix11.svg" alt="alt tag" title="usage of tuplet"></p>
<p>In the example above, the three quarter notes are defined in the
<em>Rhythm</em> block embedded in the <em>Tuplet</em> block. As with the <em>Simple
Tuplet</em> example, they are played in the time of a single quarter
note. The result is three twelfth notes. This more complex form allows
for intermixing multiple rhythms within single tuplet.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix12.svg" alt="alt tag" title="embedding rhythm and Tuplet block"></p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix13.svg" alt="alt tag" title="tuplet and rhythmic note values"></p>
<p>In the example above, the two <em>Rhythm</em> blocks are embedded in the
<em>Tuplet</em> block, resulting in a more complex rhythm.</p>
<p>Note: You can mix and match <em>Rhythm</em> blocks and <em>Tuplet</em> blocks when
defining your matrix.</p>
<h4 id="-a-name-what-is-tuplet-a-4-2-4-what-is-a-tuplet-"><a name="WHAT-IS-TUPLET"></a>4.2.4 What is a Tuplet?</h4>

<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix14.svg" alt="alt tag"></p>
<p>You can also use individual notes when defining the grid. These blocks
will expand into <em>Rhythm</em> blocks with the corresponding values.</p>
<h4 id="-a-name-using-a-scale-a-4-2-6-using-a-scale-of-pitches-in-the-matrix"><a name="USING-A-SCALE"></a>4.2.6 Using a Scale of Pitches in the Matrix</h4>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix15.svg" alt="alt tag"></p>
<p>You can use the <em>Scalar step</em> block to generate a scale of pitches in
the matrix. In the example above, the pitches comprising the G major
scale in the 4th octave are added to the grid. Note that in order to
put the highest note on top, the first pitch is the <code>Sol</code> in <code>Octave
5</code>. From there, we use <code>-1</code> as the argument to the <em>Scalar step</em> block
inside the <em>Repeat</em>, working our way down to <code>Sol</code> in <code>Octave
4</code>. Another detail to note is the use of the <em>Mode length</em> block.</p>
<h3 id="-a-name-rhythms-a-4-3-generating-rhythms"><a name="rhythms"></a>4.3 Generating Rhythms</h3>
<p>The <em>Rhythm Ruler</em> block is used to launch a widget similar to the
<em>Pitch-time Matrix</em> block. The widget can be used to generate rhythmic
patterns.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/rhythm1.svg" alt="alt tag" title="generating rhythms"></p>
<p>The argument to the <em>Rhythm Ruler</em> block specifies the duration that
will be subdivided to generate a rhythmic pattern. By default, it is 1
/ 1, e.g., a whole note.</p>
<p>The <em>Set Drum</em> blocks contained in the clamp of the <em>Rhythm Ruler</em>
block indicates the number of rhythms to be defined simultaneously. By
default, two rhythms are defined. The embedded <em>Rhythm</em> blocks define
the initial subdivision of each rhythm ruler.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/rhythm2.svg" alt="alt tag" title="rhythm ruler"></p>
<p>When the <em>Rhythm Ruler</em> block is clicked, the <em>Rhythm Ruler</em> widget is
opened. It contains a row for each rhythm ruler. An input in the top
row of the widget is used to specify how many subdivisions will be
created within a cell when it is clicked. By default, 2 subdivisions
are created.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/rhythm3.svg" alt="alt tag" title="usage of rhythm ruler"></p>
<p>As shown in the above figure, the top rhythm ruler has been divided
into two half-notes and the bottom rhythm ruler has been divided into
three third-notes. Clicking on the <em>Play</em> button to the left of each row
will playback the rhythm using a drum for each beat. The <em>Play-all</em>
button on the upper-left of the widget will play back all rhythms
simultaneously.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/rhythm4.svg" alt="alt tag" title="divide cells in rhythm ruler"></p>
<p>The rhythm can be further subdivided by clicking in individual
cells. In the example above, two quarter-notes have been created by
clicking on one of the half-notes.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/rhythm8.svg" alt="alt tag" title="tie cells in Rhythm Ruler"></p>
<p>By dragging across multiple cells, they become tied. In the example
above, two third-notes have been tied into one two-thirds-note.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/rhythm5.svg" alt="alt tag" title="save stack button"></p>
<p>The <em>Save stack</em> button will export rhythm stacks.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/rhythm6.svg" alt="alt tag" title="stacks of rhythms"></p>
<p>These stacks of rhythms can be used to define rhythmic patterns used
with the <em>Pitch-time Matrix</em> block.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/rhythm7.svg" alt="alt tag" title="save drum machine button"></p>
<p>The <em>Save drum machine</em> button will export <em>Start</em> stacks that will
play the rhythms as drum machines.</p>
<p>Another feature of the <em>Rhythm Ruler</em> wigdet is the ability to tap out
a rhythm. By clicking on the <em>Tap</em> button and then clicking on a cell
inside one of the rhythm rulers, you will be prompted (by four tones)
to begin tapping the mouse button to divide the cell into
sub-cells. Once the fourth tone has sounded, a progress bar will run
from left to right across the screen. Each click of the mouse will
define another beat within the cell. If you don&#39;t like your rhythm,
use the <em>Undo</em> button and try again.</p>
<h3 id="-a-name-modes-a-4-4-musical-modes"><a name="modes"></a>4.4 Musical Modes</h3>
<p>Musical modes are used to specify the relationship between
<a href="#INTERVALS-AND-ARTICULATION">intervals</a> (or steps) in a scale. Since
Western music is based on 12 half-steps per octave, modes speficy how
many half steps there are between each note in a scale.</p>
<p>By default, Music Blocks uses the <em>Major</em> mode, which, in the
<a href="#SETTING">Key</a> of C, maps to the white keys on a piano. The intervals
in the <em>Major</em> mode are <code>2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1</code>. Many other common modes
are built into Music Blocks, including, of course, <em>Minor</em> mode, which
uses <code>2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2</code> as its intervals.</p>
<p>Note that not every mode uses 7 intervals per octave. For example, the
<em>Chromatic</em> mode uses 11 intervals: <code>1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1</code>. The <em>Japanese</em> mode uses only 5 intervals: <code>1, 4,
2, 3, 2],</code>. What is important is that the sum of the intervals
in an octave is 12 half-steps.</p>
<p>The <em>Mode length</em> block will return the number of intervals (scalar
steps) in the current mode.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/mode1.svg" alt="alt tag" title="mode widget"></p>
<p>The <em>Mode</em> widget lets you explore modes and generate custom
modes. You invoke the widget with the <em>Custom mode</em> block. The mode
specified in the <em>Set key</em> block will be the default mode when the
widget launches.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/mode2.svg" alt="alt tag" title="launching widget with Major mode"></p>
<p>In the above example, the widget has been launched with <em>Major</em> mode
(the default). Note that the notes included in the mode are indicated by
the black boxes, which are arrayed in a circular pattern of tweleve
half-steps to complete the octave.</p>
<p>Since the intervals in the <em>Major</em> mode are <code>2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1</code>, the
notes are <code>0</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>4</code>, <code>5</code>, <code>7</code>, <code>9</code>,<code>11</code>, and <code>12</code> (one octave
above <code>0</code>).</p>
<p>The widget controls run along the toolbar at the top. From left to
right are:</p>
<p><em>Play all</em>, which will play a scale using the current mode;</p>
<p><em>Save</em>, which will save the current mode as the <em>Custom</em> mode and save
a stack of <em>Pitch</em> blocks that can be used with the <em>Pitch-time
Matrix</em> block;</p>
<p><em>Rotate counter-clockwise</em>, which will rotate the mode
counter-clockwise (See the example below);</p>
<p><em>Rotate clockwise</em>, which will rotate the mode clockwise (See the
example below);</p>
<p><em>Invert</em>, which will invert the mode (See the example below);</p>
<p><em>Undo</em>, which will restore the mode to the previous version; and</p>
<p><em>Close</em>, which will close the widget.</p>
<p>You can also click on individual notes to activate or deactivate them.</p>
<p>Note that the mode inside the <em>Custom mode</em> block is updated whenever
the mode is changed inside the widget.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/mode3.svg" alt="alt tag" title="creating Dorian mode"></p>
<p>In the above example, the <em>Major</em> mode has been rotated clockwise,
transforming it into <em>Dorian</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/mode4.svg" alt="alt tag" title="creating Locrian mode"></p>
<p>In the above example, the <em>Major</em> mode has been rotated
counter-clockwise, transforming it into <em>Locrian</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/mode5.svg" alt="alt tag" title="creating Phrygian mode"></p>
<p>In the above example, the <em>Major</em> mode has been inverted, transforming
it into <em>Phrygian</em>.</p>
<p>Note: The build-in modes in Music Blocks can be found in <a href="https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/blob/master/js/musicutils.js#L68">musicutils.js</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/mode6.svg" alt="alt tag" title="Pitch-time Matrix block"></p>
<p>The <em>Save</em> button exports a stack of blocks representing the mode that
can be used inside the <em>Pitch-time Matrix</em> block.</p>
<h3 id="-a-name-pitch-drum-a-4-5-the-pitch-drum-matrix"><a name="pitch-drum"></a>4.5 The Pitch-Drum Matrix</h3>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/drum2.svg" alt="alt tag" title="Pitch-drum matrix"></p>
<p>The <em>Set Drum</em> block is used to map the enclosed pitches into drum
sounds. Drum sounds are played in a monopitch using the specified drum
sample. In the example above, a <code>kick drum</code> will be substitued for
each occurance of a <code>Re</code> <code>4</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/drum8.svg" alt="alt tag" title="pitch-drum matrix 1"></p>

<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/drum7.svg" alt="alt tag" title="pitch-drum matrix 1"></p>
<p>As an experience for creating mapping with the <em>Set Drum</em> block, we
provide the <em>Drum-Pitch</em> Matrix. You use it to map between pitches and
drums. The output is a stack of <em>Set Dum</em> blocks.</p>
<h3 id="-a-name-stairs-a-4-6-exploring-musical-proportions"><a name="stairs"></a>4.6 Exploring Musical Proportions</h3>
<p>The <em>Pitch Staircase</em> block is used to launch a widget similar to the
<em>Pitch-time Matrix</em>, which can be used to generate different pitches
using a given pitch and musical proportion.</p>
<p>The <em>Pitch</em> blocks contained in the clamp of the <em>Pitch Staircase</em>
block define the pitches to be initialized simultaneously. By default,
one pitch is defined and it have default note &quot;la&quot; and octave &quot;3&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/pitchstaircase0.svg" alt="alt tag" title="generating arbitrary pitches"></p>
<p>When <em>Pitch Staircase</em> block is clicked, the <em>Pitch Staircase</em> widget is
initialized. The widget contains row for every <em>Pitch</em> block contained
in the clamp of the <em>Pitch Staircase</em> block. The input fields in the top
row of the widget specify the musical proportions used to create new
pitches in the staircase. The inputs correspond to the numerator and
denominator in the proportion resectively. By default the proportion
is 3:2.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/pitchstaircase1.svg" alt="alt tag" title="notes associated with the step in the stairs"></p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/pitchstaircase2.svg" alt="alt tag" title="notes associated with the step in the stairs"></p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/pitchstaircase3.svg" alt="alt tag" title="notes associated with the step in the stairs"></p>
<p>Clicking on the <em>Play</em> button to the left of each row will playback
the notes associated with that step in the stairs. The <em>Play-all</em>
button on the upper-left of the widget will play back all the pitch
steps simultaneously. A second <em>Play-all</em> button to the right of the
stair plays in increasing order of frequency first, then in 
decreasing order of frequency as well, completing a scale.</p>
<p>The <em>Save stack</em> button will export pitch stacks. For example, in the
above configuration, the output from pressing the <em>Save stack</em> button
is shown below:</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/pitchstaircase4.svg" alt="alt tag" title="Pitch Stair block"></p>
<p>These stacks can be used with the <em>Pitch-time Matrix</em> block to define
the rows in the matrix.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/pitchstaircase5.svg" alt="alt tag" title="Pitch Stair block"></p>
<h3 id="-a-name-slider-a-4-7-generating-arbritary-pitches"><a name="slider"></a>4.7 Generating Arbritary Pitches</h3>
<p>The <em>Pitch Slider</em> block is used to launch a widget that is used to
generate arbitray pitches. It differs from the <em>Pitch Staircase</em>
widget in that it is used to create frequencies that vary continuously
within the range of a specified octave.</p>
<p>Each <em>Sine</em> block contained within the clamp of the <em>Pitch Slider</em> block defines the initial pitch
for an ocatve.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/pitchslider0.svg" alt="alt tag" title="Pitch Slider"> </p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/pitchslider1.svg" alt="alt tag" title="Pitch Slider-One Column"></p>
<p>When the <em>Pitch Slider</em> block is clicked, the <em>Pitch Slider</em> widget is
initialized. The widget will have one column for each <em>Sine</em> block in
the clamp. Every column has a slider that can be used to move up or
down in frequency, continuously or in intervals of 1/12th of the
starting frequency. The mouse is used to move the frequency up and
down continuously. Buttons are used for intervals. Arrow keys can also
be used to move up and down, or between columns.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/pitchslider0a.svg" alt="alt tag" title="Pitch Slider Block"></p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/pitchslider2.svg" alt="alt tag" title="Pitch Slider-Two Column"></p>
<p>Clicking in a column will extact the corresponding <em>Note</em> blocks, for example:</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/pitchslider3.svg" alt="alt tag" title="Pitch Slider-Two Columns Adjusting"></p>

<h3 id="-a-name-tempo-a-4-8-changing-tempo"><a name="tempo"></a>4.8 Changing Tempo</h3>
<p>The <em>Tempo</em> block is used to launch a widget that enables the user to
visualize Tempo, defined in beats per minute (BPM). When the <em>Tempo</em> block
is clicked, the <em>Tempo</em> widget is initialized.</p>
<p>The <em>Master Beats per Minute</em> block contained in the clamp of the
<em>Tempo</em> block sets the initial tempo used by the widget. This
determines the speed at which the ball in the widget moves back and
forth. If BPM is <code>60</code>, then it will take one second for the ball to move
across the widget. A round-trip would take two seconds.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/tempo0.svg" alt="alt tag" title="changing tempo"></p>
<p>The top row of the widget holds the <em>Play/pause</em> button, the <em>Speed
up</em> and <em>Slow down</em> buttons, and an input field for updating the
Tempo.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/tempo1.svg" alt="alt tag" title="changing tempo"></p>
<p>You can also update the tempo by clicking twice in spaced succession
in the widget: the new beats per minute (BPM) is determined as the
time between the two clicks. For example, if there is <code>1/2</code> second
between clicks, the new BPM will be set as <code>120</code>.</p>
<h3 id="-a-name-timbre-a-4-9-custom-timbres"><a name="timbre"></a>4.9 Custom Timbres</h3>
<p>While Music Blocks comes with many built-in instruments, it is also
possible to create custom timbres with unique sound qualities.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/timbre1.svg" alt="alt tag" title="the Timbre widget"></p>
<p>The <em>Timbre</em> block can be used to launch the <em>Timbre</em> widget, which
lets you add synthesizers, oscillators, effects, and filters to create
a custom timbre, which can be used in your Music Blocks programs.</p>
<p>The name of the custom timbre is defined by the argment passed to the
block (by default, <code>custom</code>). This name is passed to the <em>Set timbre</em>
block in order to use your custom timbre.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/timbre2.svg" alt="alt tag" title="the Timbre widget toolbar"></p>
<p>The <em>Timbre</em> widget has a number of different panels, each of which is
used to set the parameters of the components that define your custom
timbre.</p>

<p>As you add synthesizers, effects, and filters with the widget, blocks
corresponding to your choices are added to the <em>Timbre</em> block. This
lets you reopen the widget to fine-tune your custom timbre.</p>

<p>Music Blocks is a waypoint, not a destination. One of the goals is to
point the learner towards other powerful tools. One such tool is
<a href="http://lilypond.org">Lilypond</a>, a music engraving program.</p>
<p><img src="https://rawgithub.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/master/guide/lilypond1.svg" alt="alt tag" title="adding Save as Lilypond block"></p>
<p>The <em>Save as Lilypond</em> block will transcribe your composition. The
output of the program above is saved to <code>Downloads/hotdog.ly</code>. There is
also a <em>Save as Lilypond</em> button on the secondary toolbar.</p>
<p>Note that if you use a <em>Print</em> block inside of a note, Lilypond will
create a &quot;markup&quot; or annotation for that note. It is a simple way to
add lyrics to your score.</p>
