<h1>Guide to Programming with Music Blocks</h1>

<p>Music Blocks is a programming environment for children interested in
music and graphics. It expands upon Turtle Blocks in that it has a
collection of features relating to pitch and rhythm.</p>

<p>The Turtle Blocks guide is a good place to start learning about the
basics. In this guide, we illustrate the music features walking the
reader through numerous examples.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>Music Blocks is designed to run in a browser. Most of the development
has been done in Chrome, but it should also work in Firefox (although
you may need to disable hardware acceleration). You can run it from
<a href="http://walterbender.github.io/musicblocks">github io</a> or by
downloading a copy of the code and running directly from the file
system of your computer.</p>

<p>For more details on how to use Music Blocks, see <a href="http://github.com/walterbender/musicblocks/tree/master/documentation">Using Music
Blocks</a>
and for more details on how to use Turtle Blocks, see <a href="http://github.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/tree/master/documentation">Using Turtle
Blocks
JS</a>.</p>

<h2>ABOUT THIS GUIDE</h2>

<p>Many of the examples given in the guide have links to code you can
run. Look for RUN LIVE links.</p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<p>Music Blocks exposed the common elements of music: pitch, rhythm, and
sonic quality, e.g., loudness and softness, and to some degree, timbre
and texture.</p>

<p>At the heart of Music Blocks is the <em>Note value</em> block. The <em>Note
value</em> block is a container for a pitch that specifies the duration
(note value) of the pitch. (The <em>Pitch</em> block is detailed below.)</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/note1.svg'</img></p>

<p>At the top of the example above, a single <em>Note value</em> block is
shown. The <code>4</code> is the note value, in this case, a quarter note. The
pitch, specified by the <em>Pitch</em> block, contains a pitch, <code>Re</code> at
<code>Octave 4</code>. At the bottom, two consecutive notes are shown.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/note2.svg'</img></p>

<p>In this example, different note values are shown. From top to bottom,
<code>8</code> for an eighth note, <code>16</code> for a sixteenth note, and <code>2</code> for a half
note.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/note3.svg'</img></p>

<p>As we have seen, <em>Pitch</em> blocks are used inside the <em>Note value</em>
blocks. The <em>Pitch</em> block specifies a pitch name and pitch octave that
in combination determine the frequency at which a note is played.</p>

<p>You can plug different values into the <em>Pitch</em> block name and octave
slots. Some examples are shown above. Starting from the top, the pitch
name block is specified using a <em>Solfege</em> block (<code>Sol</code> in <code>Octave 6</code>);
the pitch name is specified using a <em>Ppppppitch-name</em> block (<code>B flat</code> in
<code>Octave 4</code>); the pitch name is specified using a <em>Number</em> block (<code>440</code>
Hertz).</p>

<p>The octave is specified using a number block and is restricted to
whole numbers. In the case where the pitch name is specified by
frequency, the octave is ignored.</p>

<p>Note that the pitch name can also be specified using a <em>Text</em> block.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/note4.svg'</img></p>

<p>A chord (multiple, simultaneous pitches) can be specified by add
multiple <em>Pitch</em> blocks to a <em>Note value</em> container.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/silence.svg'</img></p>

<p>A rest of duration note value can be constructed using a <em>Silence</em> block.</p>

<h2>Using drums</h2>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/drum1.svg'</img></p>

<p>Anywhere you can use a <em>Pitch</em> block&ndash;e.g., inside of the matrix or a
<em>Note value</em> block&ndash;you can also specify a drum sample. Currently there
about two dozen different samples from which to choose. The default
drum is a kick drum.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/note5.svg'</img></p>

<p>Just as in the chord example above, you can use multiple <em>Drum</em> blocks
within a single <em>Note value</em> block and combine them with <em>Pitch</em>
blocks.</p>

<h2>THE PITCH-TIME MATRIX</h2>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix1.svg'</img></p>

<p>Music Blocks provides a widget, the <em>Pitch-time Matrix</em>, as a scaffold
for getting started.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve launched Music Blocks in your browser, start by clicking
on the <em>Pitch-time Matrix</em> stack that appears in the middle of the
screen. (For the moment, ignore the <em>Start</em> block.) You&rsquo;ll see a grid
organized vertically by pitch and horizontally by rhythm.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix2.svg'</img></p>

<p>The matrix in the figure above has three <em>Pitch</em> blocks and one
<em>Rhythm</em> block, which is used to create a 3 x 3 grid of pitch and
time.</p>

<p>Note that the default matrix has five <em>Pitch</em> blocks, hence, you will
see five rows, one for each pitch. (A sixth row at the bottom is used
for specifying the rhythms associated with each note.) Also by
default, there are two <em>Rhythm</em> blocks, which specifies six quarter
notes followed by one half note. Since the <em>Rhythm</em> blocks are inside
of a <em>Repeat</em> block, there are fourteen (2 x 7) columns for selecting
notes.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix3.svg'</img></p>

<p>By clicking on individual cells in the grid, you should hear
individual notes (or chords if you click on more than one cell in a
column). In the figure, three quarter notes are selected (black
cells). First <code>Re 4</code>, followed by <code>Mi 4</code>, followed by <code>Sol 4</code>.</p>

<p><img
src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/header-icons/play-button.svg'
height="36"</img></p>

<p>If you click on the <em>Play</em> button (found in the top row of the grid),
you will hear a sequence of notes played (from left to right): <code>Re 4</code>,
<code>Mi 4</code>, <code>Sol 4</code>.</p>

<p><img
src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/header-icons/export-chunk.svg'
height="36"</img></p>

<p>Once you have a group of notes (a &ldquo;chunk&rdquo;) that you like, click on the
<em>Save</em> button (just to the right of the <em>Play</em> button). This will
create a stack of blocks that can used to play these same notes
programmatically. (More on that below.)</p>

<p>You can rearrange the selected notes in the grid and safe other chunks
as well.</p>

<p><img
src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/header-icons/sort.svg'
height="36"</img></p>

<p>The <em>Sort</em> button will reorder the pitches in the matrix from highest
to lowest and eliminate any duplicate <em>Pitch</em> blocks.</p>

<p><img
src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/header-icons/close-button.svg'
height="36"</img></p>

<p>Or hide the matrix by clicking on the <em>Close</em> button (the right-most
button in the top row of the grid.)</p>

<p><img
src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/header-icons/erase-button.svg'
height="36"</img></p>

<p>There is also an Erase button that will clear the grid.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry. You can reopen the matrix at anytime (it will remember
its previous state) and since you can define as many chunks as you
want, feel free to experiment.</p>

<p>Tip: You can put a chunk inside a <em>Pitch-time Matrix</em> block to generate
the matrix to corresponds to that chunk.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix4.svg'</img></p>

<p>The chunk created when you click on the matrix is a stack of
blocks. The blocks are nested: an <em>Action</em> block contains three <em>Note value</em>
blocks, each of which contains a <em>Pitch</em> block. The <em>Action</em> block has a
name automatically generated by the matrix, in this case, chunk. (You
can rename the action by clicking on the name.). Each note has a
duration (in this case 4, which represents a quarter note). Try
putting different numbers in and see (hear) what happens. Each note
block also has a pitch block (if it were a chord, there would be
multiple <em>Pitch</em> blocks nested inside the Note block&rsquo;s clamp). Each
pitch block has a pitch name (<code>Re</code>, <code>Mi</code>, and <code>Sol</code>), and a pitch octave; in
this example, the octave is 4 for each pitch. (Try changing the pitch
names and the pitch octaves.)</p>

<p>To play the chuck, simply click on the action block (on the word
action). You should hear the notes play, ordered from top to bottom.</p>

<h2>About the Rhythm Block</h2>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix6.svg'</img></p>

<p><em>Rhythm</em> blocks are used to generate rhythm patterns in the
<em>Pitch-time Matrix</em> block. The top argument to the <em>Rhythm</em> block
<em>is the number of notes. The bottom argument is the duration of the
</em>note. In the top example above, three columns for quarter notes
<em>would be generated in the matrix. In the middle example, one column
</em>for an eighth note would be generated. In the bottom example, seven
columns for 16th notes would be generated.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix7.svg'</img></p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix8.svg'</img></p>

<p>You can use as many <em>Rhythm</em> blocks as you&rsquo;d like inside the
<em>Pitch-time Matrix</em> block. In the above example, two <em>Rhythm</em>
blocks are used, resulting in three quarter notes and six eighth
notes.</p>

<h2>Creating Tuplets</h2>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix9.svg'</img></p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix10.svg'</img></p>

<p>Tuplets are a collection of notes that get scaled to a specific
duration. Using tuplets makes it easy to create groups of notes that
are not based on a power of 2. In the example above, three quarter
notes&ndash;defined in the <em>Rhythm</em> block&ndash;are played in the time of a
single quarter note. The result is three twelfth notes.</p>

<p>You can mix and match <em>Rhythm</em> blocks and <em>Tuplet</em> blocks when
defining your matrix.</p>

<h2>Using individual notes in the matrix</h2>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix11.svg'</img></p>

<p>You can also use individual notes when defining the grid. These blocks
will expand into <em>Rhythm</em> blocks with corresponding values.</p>

<h2>PROGRAMMING WITH MUSIC</h2>

<p>The remainder of this guide discusses how to use the chunks created by
the <em>Pitch-time Matrix</em> when programming (You can also program with
chunks you create and/or modify by hand).</p>

<h2>1. A chunk of notes</h2>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix4.svg'</img></p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/chunk1.svg'</img></p>

<p>Every time you create a new <em>Action</em> stack, Music Blocks creates a new
block specific to that stack. (The new block is found at the top of
the <em>Block</em> palette, found on the left edge of the screen.) Clicking
on this block is the same as clicking on your stack. By default, the
new blocks are named <code>chunk</code>, <code>chunk1</code>, <code>chunk2</code>&hellip; but you can rename
them by editing the labels on the <em>Action</em> blocks.</p>

<p>In the example above, the <em>Chunk</em> block is inside of a <em>Start</em> block,
which ties it to the <em>Run</em> button in the upper-left corner of the
screen (the &ldquo;rabbit&rdquo;). Try clicking on the <em>Run</em> button. Also try the
<em>Run Slow</em> button (the &ldquo;turtle&rdquo;) and the <em>Step</em> button (the &ldquo;snail&rdquo;),
which steps through the program one block per button press. There are
also buttons for playing the music back slowly and for stepping one
note per button press.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/chunk2.svg'</img></p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/chunk3.svg'</img></p>

<p>You can repeat chunks either by using multiple <em>Chunk</em> blocks or using a
<em>Repeat</em> block.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/chunk4.svg'</img></p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/chunk5.svg'</img></p>

<p>You can also mix and match chunks. Here we play chunk, followed by
chunk1 twice, and then chunk again.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/chunk6.svg'</img></p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/chunk7.svg'</img></p>

<p>A few more chunks and we can make a song. (Can you read the block
notation in order to guess what song we&rsquo;ve programmed?)</p>

<h2>2. Transformations</h2>

<p>There are many ways to transform pitch, rhythm, and other qualities of
the sound.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform0.svg'</img></p>

<p>The <em>Step Pitch</em> block will move up or down notes in a scale from the
current note. In the example above, <em>Step Pitch</em> blocks are used inside
of <em>Repeat</em> blocks to play up and down a scale.</p>

<p><a href="http://walterbender.github.io/musicblocks/?file=MusicBlocks_scales.tb&amp;run=true">RUN LIVE</a></p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform1.svg'</img></p>

<p>The <em>Sharp</em> and <em>Flat</em> blocks can be wrapped around <em>Pitch</em>
blocks, <em>Note value</em> blocks, or chunks. A sharp will raise the pitch by
one half step. A flat will lower by one half step. In the example, on
the left, just the <em>Pitch</em> block <code>Mi</code> is lowered by one half step;
on the right, both pitch blocks are raised by one half step.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform2.svg'</img></p>

<p>The <em>Adjust-transposition</em> block can be used to make larger shifts in
pitch. To shift an entire octave, transpose by 12 half-steps up. -12
will shift an octave down.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform3.svg'</img></p>

<p>In the example above, we take the song we programmed previously and
raise it by one octave.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform4.svg'</img></p>

<p>You can &ldquo;dot&rdquo; notes using the <em>Dot</em> block. A dotted note extends by
50%. E.g., a dotted quarter note will play for 3/8 (&frac14; + 1/8) of a
beat. A dotted eighth note will play for 3/16 (1/8 + 1/16) of a beat.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform5.svg'</img></p>

<p>You can also multiply (or divide) the beat value, which will speed up
or slowdown the notes.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform6.svg'</img></p>

<p>There are several ways to repeat notes. The <em>Repeat</em> block will play a
sequence of notes multiple times; the <em>Duplicate</em> block will repeat each
note in a sequence.</p>

<p>In the example, on the left, the result would be <code>Sol, Re, Sol, Sol,
Re, Sol, Sol, Re, Sol, Sol, Re, Sol</code>; on the right the result would be
<code>Sol, Sol, Sol, Sol, Re, Re, Re, Re, Sol, Sol, Sol, Sol</code>.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform7.svg'</img></p>

<p>The <em>Swing</em> block works on pairs of notes, adding some duration to the
first note and taking the same amount from the second note.</p>

<p>Tie also works on pairs of notes, combining them into one note. (The
notes must be identical in pitch, but can vary in rhythm.)</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform8.svg'</img></p>

<p>The <em>Set volume</em> block will change the volume of the notes. The
default is 50; the range is 0 (silence) to 100 (full volume).</p>

<p>The <em>Crescendo</em> block will increase (or decrease) the volume of the
contained notes by an amount specified.</p>

<p>The <em>Staccato</em> block will play back notes in tight bursts while
maintaining the specified rhymic value of the notes.</p>

<p>The <em>Slur</em> block will run a note past its noted duration, blending
it into the next note.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform9.svg'</img></p>

<p>The <em>Interval</em> block calculates an interval, e.g., a fifth, and adds
the additional pitches to a note. In the figure, we add <code>Sol</code> to <code>Do</code> and
<code>Do</code> to <code>Fa</code>.</p>

<p>The <em>Articulation</em> block changes the volume of a group of notes.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform11.svg'</img></p>

<p>The <em>Backward</em> block will play the contained notes in
reverse order. In the example above, the notes in <em>Chunk</em> are
played as <code>Sol, Ti, La, Sol</code>, e.g., from the bottom to the
top of the stack.</p>

<p><a href="http://walterbender.github.io/musicblocks/?file=MusicBlocks_crab_canon.tb&amp;run=true">RUN
LIVE</a></p>

<p>Note that <em>all</em> of the blocks inside a <em>Backward</em>
block are reverse, so use this feature with caution if you include
logic intermixed with notes.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform10.svg'</img></p>

<p>The <em>Set Key</em> block will change the key and mode of the mapping
between solfege, e.g., <code>Do</code>, <code>Re</code>, <code>Mi</code>, to note names, e.g., <code>C</code>,
<code>D</code>, <code>E</code>, when in C Major. Modes include Major and Minor, Chromatic,
and a number of more exotic modes, such as Bebop, Geez, Maqam, et al.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/drum4.svg'</img></p>

<p>In the above example, the sequence of drum beats is increased over time.</p>

<p><a href="http://walterbender.github.io/musicblocks/?file=MusicBlocks_drumexample.tb&amp;run=true">RUN LIVE</a></p>

<h2>The Pitch Drum Matrix</h2>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/drum2.svg'</img></p>

<p>The <em>Set Drum</em> block is used to map the enclosed pitches into drum
sounds. Drum sounds are played in a monopitch using the specified drum
sample. In the example above, a <code>kick drum</code> will be substitued for
each occurance of a <code>Re</code> <code>4</code>.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/drum8.svg'</img></p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/drum5.svg'</img></p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/drum6.svg'</img></p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/drum7.svg'</img></p>

<p>As an expedience for creating mapping with the <em>Set Drum</em> block, we
provide the <em>Drum-Pitch</em> Matrix. You use it to map between pitches and
drums. The output is a stack of <em>Set Dum</em> blocks.</p>

<h2>3. Voices</h2>

<p>Each <em>Start</em> block runs as a separate voice in Music Blocks. (When
you click on the Run button, all of the <em>Start</em> blocks are run
concurrently.)</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/voices1.svg'</img></p>

<p>If we put our song into an action&hellip;</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/voices2.svg'</img></p>

<p>&hellip;we can run it from multiple <em>Start</em> blocks.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/voices3.svg'</img></p>

<p>It gets more interesting if we shift up and down octaves.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/voices4.svg'</img></p>

<p>And even more interesting if we bring the various voices offset in time.</p>

<p><a href="http://walterbender.github.io/musicblocks/?file=MusicBlocks_frerejacques.tb&amp;run=true">RUN LIVE</a></p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/drum3.svg'</img></p>

<p>A special &ldquo;drum&rdquo; version of the <em>Start</em> block is available for laying
down a drum track. Any pitch blocks encounted while starting from a
drum will be played as <code>C2</code> with the default drum sample. In the
example above, all of the notes in <code>chunk</code> will be played with a kick
drum.</p>

<h2>4. Adding graphics</h2>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/graphics1.svg'</img></p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/graphics2.png'</img></p>

<p>Turtle graphics can be combined with the music blocks. By placing
graphics blocks, e.g., <em>Forward</em> and <em>Right</em>, inside of <em>Note value</em>
blocks, the graphics stay in sync with the music. In this example, the
turtle moves forward each time a quarter note is played. It turns
right during the eighth note. The pitch is raised by one half step,
the pen size decreases, and the pen color increases at each step in
the inner repeat loop.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/graphics3.svg'</img></p>

<p>In this example, the graphics are synchronized to the music by placing
the graphics commands inside of <em>Note value</em> blocks.</p>

<p><a href="http://walterbender.github.io/musicblocks/?file=MusicBlocks_sync_graphics.tb&amp;run=true">RUN LIVE</a></p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/fibonacci3.svg'</img></p>

<p>In this example, because the computation and graphics are more
complex, a <em>Free-time</em> block is used to decouple the graphics from
the master clock.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/graphics4.png'</img></p>

<h2>5. Interaction</h2>

<p>There are many ways to interactive with Music Blocks, including
tracking the mouse position to impact some aspect of the music.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/interactive.svg'</img></p>

<p>For example, we can launch the phrases (chunks) interactively. When
the mouse is in the lower-left quadrant, <code>chunk</code> is played;
lower-right quadrant, <code>chunk1</code>; upper-left quadrant, <code>chunk2</code>; and
upper-right quadrant, <code>chunk3</code>.</p>

<p><a href="http://walterbender.github.io/musicblocks/?file=MusicBlocks_interactivefrerejacques.tb&amp;run=true">RUN LIVE</a></p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/interactive2.svg'</img></p>

<p>In the example above, a simple two-key piano is created by associating
<em>click</em> events on two different turtles with individual notes. Can you
make an 8-key piano?</p>

<p><a href="http://walterbender.github.io/musicblocks/?file=MusicBlocks_twokey_piano.tb&amp;run=true">RUN LIVE</a></p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/interactive3.svg'</img></p>

<p>You can also add a bit of randomness to your music. In the top example
above, the <em>One-of</em> block is used to randomly assign either <code>Do</code> or
<code>Re</code> each time the <em>Note value</em> block is played. In the bottom example
above, the <em>One-of</em> block is used to randomly select between <code>chunk1</code>
and <code>chunk2</code>.</p>

<h2>6. Generating Rhythms</h2>

<p>The <em>Rhythm Ruler</em> block is used to launch a widget similar to the
<em>Matrix</em>, which can be used to generate rhythmic patterns.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/rhythm1.svg'</img></p>

<p>The argument to the <em>Rhythm Ruler</em> block specifies the
duration that will be subdivided to generate a rhythmic pattern. By
default, it is 1 / 1, e.g., a whole note.</p>

<p>The <em>Set Drum</em> blocks contained in the clamp of
the <em>Rhythm Ruler</em> block define the number of rhythms to be
defined simultaneously. By default, two rhythms are defined. The
embedded <em>Rhythm</em> blocks define the initial subdivision of the
of each rhythm ruler.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/rhythm2.svg'</img></p>

<p>When the <em>Rhythm Ruler</em> block is clicked, the <em>Rhythm Ruler</em>
widget is opened. It contains a row for each rhythm ruler. An input in
the top row of the widget is used to specify how many subdivisions
will be created within a cell when it is clicked. By default, 2
subdivisions are created.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/rhythm3.svg'</img></p>

<p>As shown in the above figure, the top rhythm ruler has been divided
into two half-notes and the bottom rhythm ruler has been divided into
three third-notes. Clicking on the <em>Play</em> button to the left of
each row will playback the rhythm using a drum for each
beat. The <em>Play-all</em> button on the upper-left of the widget
will play back all rhythms simultaneously.
</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/rhythm4.svg'</img></p>

<p>The rhythm can be further subdivided by clicking in individual
cells. In the example above, two quarter-notes have been created by
clicking on one of the half-notes.
</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/rhythm5.svg'</img></p>

<p>The <em>Save stack</em> button will export rhythm stacks.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/rhythm6.svg'</img></p>

<p>These stacks of rhythms can be used to define rhythmic patterns in
the <em>Matrix</em>.</p>


<h2>7. Musical Modes</h2>

<p>Musical modes are used to specify the relationship between intervals
(or steps) in a scale. Since Western music is based on 12 half-steps
per octave, modes speficy how many half steps there are between each
note in a scale.</p>

<p>By default, Music Blocks uses the <em>Major</em> mode, which, in the Key of
C, maps to the white keys on a piano. The intervals in the <em>Major</em>
mode are <code>2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1</code>. Many other common modes are
built into Music Blocks, including, of course, <em>Minor</em> mode, which
uses <code>2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2</code> as its intervals.</p>

<p>Note that not every mode uses 7 intervals per octave. For example, the
<em>Chromatic</em> mode uses 11 intervals: <code>1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1</code>. The <em>Japanese</em> mode uses only 5 intervals: <code>1, 4,
2, 3, 2],</code>. What is important is that the sum of the intervals
in an octave is 12 half-steps.</p>

<p>The <em>Mode</em> widget lets you explore modes and generate custom
modes. You invoke the widget with the <em>Custom mode</em> block. The mode
specified in the <em>Set key</em> block will be the default mode when the
widget launches.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/mode2.svg'</img></p>

<p>In the above example, the widget has been launched with <em>Major</em> mode
(the default). Note that the notes included the mode are indicated by
the black boxes, which are arrayed in a circular pattern of tweleve
half-steps to complete the octave.</p>

<p>Since the intervals in the <em>Major</em> mode are <code>2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2,
1</code>, the notes are <code>0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, </code> and
<code>12</code>, one octave above <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>The widget controls run along the toolbar at the top. From left to
right are:</p>

<p><em>Play all</em>, which will play a scale using the current mode;</p>

<p><em>Save</em>, which will save the current mode as
 the <em>Custom</em> mode and save a stack of <em>Pitch</em> blocks
 that can be used with the <em>Pitch-time Matrix</em> block</p>

<p><em>Rotate counter-clockwise</em>, which will rotate the mode
 counter-clockwise (See the example below);</p>

<p><em>Rotate clockwise</em>, which will rotate the mode clockwise (See the
 example below);</p>

<p><em>Invert</em>, which will invert the mode (See the example below);</p>

<p><em>Undo</em>, which will restore the mode to the previous version; and</p>

<p><em>Close</em>, which will close the widget.</p>

<p>You can also click on individual notes to activate or deactivate them.</p>

<p>Note that the mode inside the <em>Custom mode</em> block is updated whenever
the mode is changed inside the widget.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/mode3.svg'</img></p>

<p>In the above example, the <em>Major</em> mode has been rotated clockwise,
transforming it into <em>Dorian</em>.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/mode4.svg'</img></p>

<p>In the above example, the <em>Major</em> mode has been rotated
counter-clockwise, transforming it into <em>Locrian</em>.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/mode5.svg'</img></p>

<p>In the above example, the <em>Major</em> mode has been inverted, transforming
it into <em>Phrygian</em>.</p>

<p>Note: The build-in modes in Music Blocks can be found in <a href="https://github.com/walterbender/musicblocks/blob/master/js/musicutils.js#L68">musicutils.js</a>.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/mode6.svg'</img></p>

<p>The <em>Save</em> button exports a stack of blocks representing the mode that
can be used inside the <em>Pitch-time Matrix</em> block.</p>

<h2>8. Beyond Music Blocks</h2>

<p>Music Blocks is a waypoint, not a destination. One of the goals is to
point the learner towards other powerful tools. One such tool is
<a href="http://lilypond.org">Lilypond</a>, a music engraving program.</p>

<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/lilypond1.svg'</img></p>

<p>The <em>Save as Lilypond</em> block will transcribe your composition. The
output of the program above is saved to <code>Downloads/hotdog.ly</code>. There is
also a <em>Save as Lilypond</em> button on the secondary toolbar.</p>
