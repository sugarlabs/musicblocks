Guide to Programming with Music Blocks
======================================
  
Music Blocks is a programming environment for children interested in
music and graphics. It expands upon Turtle Blocks by adding a 
collection of features relating to pitch and rhythm.

The Turtle Blocks guide is a good place to start learning about the
basics. In this guide, we illustrate the musical features by walking the
reader through numerous examples.

Music Blocks is designed to run in a browser. Most of the development
has been done in Chrome, but it should also work in Firefox (although
you may need to disable hardware acceleration). You can run it from
[github io](http://walterbender.github.io/musicblocks) or by
downloading a copy of the code and running a local copy directly from
the file system of your computer.

For more details on how to use Music Blocks, see [Using Music
Blocks](http://github.com/walterbender/musicblocks/tree/master/documentation).

2. MAKING A SOUND
--------------------
</a>
[Previous Section (1. Getting Started)](#GETTING-STARTED) | [Back to Table of Contents](#TOC) | [Next Section (3. Programming with Music)](#PROGRAMMING-WITH-MUSIC)

Music Blocks incorporates many common elements of music, such as [pitch](#PITCH), [rhythm](#rhythms), [volume](#MORE-TRANSFORMATIONS),
and, to some degree, [timbre and texture](#VOICES).
<a name="NOTE-VALUE">
### 2.1 Note Value Blocks
</a>

At the heart of Music Blocks is the *Note value* block. The *Note
value* block is a container for a [pitch block](#PITCH) that specifies the duration
(note value) of the pitch. 

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/note1.svg'/>

At the top of the example above, a single (detached) *Note value* block is
shown. The `1/8` is value of the note, which is, in this case, an eighth note. 

At the bottom, two notes that are played consecutively are
shown. They are both `1/8` notes, making the duration of the entire sequence `1/4`. 

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/note2.svg'/>

In this example, different note values are shown. From top to bottom, they are: 
`1/4` for an quarter note, `1/16` for a sixteenth note, and `1/2` for a half
note.

Note that any mathematical operations can be used as input to the *Note value*.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/charts/NotationRestChart.svg'/>
Please refer to the above picture for a visual representation of note values.

<a name="PITCH">
### 2.2 Pitch Blocks
</a>

As we have seen, *Pitch* blocks are used inside the [*Note value*] (#NOTE-VALUE)
blocks. The *Pitch* block specifies the pitch name and pitch octave of a note
that in combination determines the frequency (and therefore pitch) at which the note is played.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/note3.svg'/>

There are many systems you can use to specify a *pitch* block's name and octave. Some examples are
shown above. The top pitch block is specified using a *Solfege* block (`Sol` in `Octave 6`), which contains
the notes `Do Re Me Fa Sol La Ti `. The middle block is specified using a *Pitch-name* block (`B flat` in `Octave 4`),
which contains the notes `C D E F G A B`. The last block is specified using the *Hertz* block in conjunction
with a *Number* block (`440` Hertz) , which corresponds to the frequency of the sound made.

The octave is specified using a number block and is restricted to
whole numbers. In the case where the pitch name is specified by
frequency, the octave is ignored.

Note that the pitch name can also be specified using a *Text* block. 

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/charts/KeyboardChart.svg'/>
Please refer to the above picture for a visual representation of where notes are located on a keyboard or staff.

<a name="CHORDS">
### 2.3 Chords
</a>
<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/note4.svg'/>

A chord (multiple, simultaneous pitches) can be specified by adding
multiple *Pitch* blocks into a single *Note value* block, like the above example.

<a name="RESTS">
### 2.4 Rests
</a>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/silence.svg'/>

A rest of the specified note value duration can be constructed using a *Silence* block in place of a *pitch* block.

<a name="DRUMS">
### 2.5 Drums
</a>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/drum1.svg'/>

Anywhere  a *Pitch* block can be used&mdash;e.g., inside of the matrix or a
*Note value* block&mdash;a *Drum Sample* block can also be used instead. Currently there
about two dozen different samples from which to choose. The default
drum is a kick drum.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/note5.svg'/>

Just as in the [chord](#CHORD) example above, you can use multiple *Drum* blocks
within a single *Note value* blocks, and combine them with *Pitch*
blocks as well.

<a name="PROGRAMMING-WITH-MUSIC">
3. PROGRAMMING WITH MUSIC
--------------------------
</a>
[Previous Section (2. Making a Sound)](#NOTES) | [Back to Table of Contents](#TOC) | [Next Section (4. Widgets)](#WIDGETS)

This section of the guide discusses how to use chunks of notes to
program music. Note that you can program with chunks you create by
hand or use the [*Pitch-time Matrix*](#pitch-time) widget to help you get started.

<a name="CHUNKS">
### 3.1 Chunks
</a>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix4.svg'/>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/chunk1.svg'/>

Every time you create a new *Action* stack, Music Blocks creates a new
block specific to, and linked with, that stack. (The new block is
found at the top of the *Block* palette, found on the left edge of the
screen.) Clicking on and running this block is the same as clicking on
your stack. By default, the new blocks are named `chunk`, `chunk1`,
`chunk2`... but you can rename them by editing the labels on the
*Action* blocks.

An *Action* block contains a sequence of actions that will only be executed
when the block is referred to by something else, such as a start block. This is useful
in orchestrating more complex programs of music.

A *Start* Block is a *chunk* that will automatically be executed once the start button is pressed.
This is where most of your programs will begin at.  There are many ways to *Run* a program: you can click
on the *Run* button at the upper-left corner of the screen (the "rabbit") to run the music at a fast speed; click on the
*Run Slow* button (the "turtle") to run it slower; and the *Step* button (the "snail"),
to step  through the program one block per button press. 


In the example above, the *Chunk* block is inside of a *Start* block, which means
that when any of the start buttons is pressed, the code inside the *Start* block (the *Chunk* block) will
be executed. You can add more chunks after this one inside the *Start* block to execute them
sequentially.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/chunk2.svg'/>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/chunk3.svg'/>

You can [repeat](#REPETITION) chunks either by using multiple *Chunk* blocks or using a
*Repeat* block.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/chunk4.svg'/>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/chunk5.svg'/>

You can also mix and match chunks. Here we play the action block with
name "chunk", followed by "chunk1" twice, and then "chunk" again.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/chunk6.svg'/>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/chunk7.svg'/>

A few more chunks and we can make a song. (Can you read the block
notation well enough to guess the outcome? Are you familiar with the
song we created?)

<a name="TRANSFORMATION">
### 3.2 Musical Transformations
</a>

There are many ways to transform pitch, rhythm, and other sonic qualities.
<a name="STEP-PITCH">
#### 3.2.1 Step Pitch Block
</a>
<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform0.svg'/>

The *Step Pitch* block will move up or down notes in a scale from the
last played note. In the example above, *Step Pitch* blocks are used inside
of *Repeat* blocks to repeat the code 7 times, playing up and down a scale.

[RUN LIVE](http://walterbender.github.io/musicblocks/?file=MusicBlocks_scales.tb&run=true)

<a name="SHARPS-AND-FLATS">
#### 3.2.2 Sharps And Flats
</a>
<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform1.svg'/>

The *Sharp* and *Flat* blocks can be wrapped around *Pitch* blocks,
*Note value* blocks, or [chunks](#CHUNKS). A sharp will raise the pitch by one
half step. A flat will lower by one half step. In the example, on the
left, just the *Pitch* block `Mi` is lowered by one half step; on the
right, both pitch blocks are raised by one half step.

<a name="ADJUST-TRANSPOSITION">
#### 3.2.3 Adjust-Transposition
</a>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform2.svg'/>

The *Adjust-transposition* block can be used to make larger shifts in
pitch in half step units. A positive number shifts the pitch up and a
negative number shifts the pitch down. The input must be a whole
number. To shift an entire octave, transpose by 12 half-steps up. -12
will shift an octave down.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform3.svg'/>

In the example above, we take the song we programmed previously and
raise it by one octave.

<a name="DOTTED">
#### 3.2.4 Dotted Notes
</a>
<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform4.svg'/>

You can "dot" notes using the *Dot* block. A dotted note extends the rhythmic duration of a note by
50%. E.g., a dotted quarter note will play for 3/8 (1/4 + 1/8) of a
beat. A dotted eighth note will play for 3/16 (1/8 + 1/16) of a beat.

You can also simply change the note value to mimic a dotted note, for example indicating 3/8 instead of 1/4, for a dotted quarter note.
<img src='https://rawgit.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/charts/DotsChart.svg'/>

<a name="MULTIPLY-AND-DIVIDE">
#### 3.2.5 Speeding Up and Slowing Down Notes via Mathematical Operations
</a>
<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform5.svg'/>

You can also multiply (or divide) the beat value, which will speed up
or slowdown the notes. Multiplying the beat value of an `1/8` note by
`2` is the equivalent of playing a `1/16` note. Dividing the beat
value of an `1/8` note by '2' is the equivalent of playing a `1/4`
note.

<a name="REPETITION">
#### 3.2.6 Repeating Notes
</a>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform6.svg'/>

There are several ways to repeat notes. The *Repeat* block will play a
sequence of notes multiple times; the *Duplicate* block will repeat each
note in a sequence.

In the example, on the left, the result would be `Sol, Re, Sol, Sol,
Re, Sol, Sol, Re, Sol, Sol, Re, Sol`; on the right the result would be
`Sol, Sol, Sol, Sol, Re, Re, Re, Re, Sol, Sol, Sol, Sol`.

<a name="SWINGING">
#### 3.2.7 Swinging Notes and Tied Notes
</a>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform7.svg'/>

The *Swing* block works on pairs of notes (specified by note value),
adding some duration (specified by swing value) to the first note and
taking the same amount from the second note. Notes that do not match
note value are unchanged.

In the example, `re5` would be played as a `1/6` note and `mi5` would
be played as a `1/12` note (`1/8 + 1/24 === 1/6` and `1/8 - 1/24 ===
1/12`). Observe that the total duration of the pair of notes is
unchanged.

Tie also works on pairs of notes, combining them into one note. (The
notes must be identical in pitch, but can vary in rhythm.)

<img src='https://rawgit.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/charts/TiesChart.svg'/>

<a name="MORE-TRANSFORMATIONS">
#### 3.2.8 Set Volume, Crescendo, Staccato, and Slur
</a>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform8.svg'/>

The *Set volume* block will change the volume of the notes. The
default is 50; the range is 0 (silence) to 100 (full volume).

The *Crescendo* block will increase (or decrease) the volume of the
contained notes by a specified amount for every note played. For
example, if you have 3 notes in sequence contained in a *Crescendo*
block with a value of 5, the final note will be at 15% more 
than the original value for volume.

The *Staccato* block shortens the length of the actual note&mdash;making them tighter
bursts&mdash;while maintaining the specified rhythmic value of the notes.

The *Slur* block lengthens the sustain of notes&mdash;running longer than
the noted duration and blending it into the next note&mdash;while
maintaining the specified rhythmic value of the notes.

<a name="INTERVALS-AND-ARTICULATION">
#### 3.2.9 Intervals and Articulation
</a>
<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform9.svg'/>

The *Interval* block calculates a relative interval, e.g., a fifth,
and adds the additional pitches to a note's playback. In the figure,
we add `La` to `Re` and `Ti` to `Mi`.

The *Articulation* block changes the volume of a group of notes without affecting the master volume for the rest of the user's Music Blocks code.

<a name= "ABSOLUTE-INTERVALS">
#### 3.2.10 Absolute Intervals
</a>
<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform14.svg'/>

The *Augmented* block calculates an absolute interval, e.g., an
augmented fifth, and adds the additional pitches to a note. Similarly,
the *Minor* block calculates an absolute interval, e.g., a minor
third. Other absolute intervals include *Perfect*, *Diminished*, and
*Major*.

In the augmented fifth example above, a chord of D5 and A5 are played,
followed by a chord of E5 and C5. In the minor third example, which
includes a shift of one octave, first a chord of D5 and F5 is played,
followed by chord of E5 and G6.

<a name= "INVERSION">
#### 3.2.11 Inversion
</a>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform13.svg'/>

The *Invert* block will invert a series of notes around a target
note. There are two different versions of the *Invert* block: *odd*
and *even*, the latter shifts the point of rotation up by a `1/4`
step, enabling rotation around a point between two notes.

In the *invert (even)* example, `D4` is inverted around `G4`,
resulting in a `C5`. In the *invert (odd)* example, `D4` is inverted
around a point midway between `G4` and `G♯4` resulting in a `C♯5`


<a name = "BACKWARDS">
#### 3.2.12 Backwards
</a>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform11.svg'/>

The *Backward* block will play the contained notes in reverse order
(retrograde). In the example above, the notes in *Chunk* are played as
`Sol`, `Ti`, `La`, `Sol`, i.e., from the bottom to the top of the
stack.

[RUN
LIVE](http://walterbender.github.io/musicblocks/?file=MusicBlocks_crab_canon.tb&run=true)

Note that all of the blocks inside a *Backward* block are reverse, so
use this feature with caution if you include logic intermixed with
notes.

<a name= "SETTING">
#### 3.2.13 Setting Voice and Keys
</a>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform12.svg'/>

The *Set Voice* block selects a [voice](#VOICES) for the synthesizer for any
contained blocks, e.g., violin or cello.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/transform10.svg'/>

The *Set Key* block will change the key and mode of the mapping
between solfege, e.g., `Do`, `Re`, `Mi`, to note names, e.g., `C`,
`D`, `E`, when in C Major. Modes include Major and Minor, Chromatic,
and a number of more exotic modes, such as Bebop, Geez, Maqam, etc. 
This block allows users to access "movable Do" within Music
Blocks, where the mapping of solfege to particular pitch changes
depending on the user's specified tonality.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/drum4.svg'/>

In the above example, the sequence of [drum](#DRUMS) beats is increased over time.

[RUN LIVE](http://walterbender.github.io/musicblocks/?file=MusicBlocks_drumexample.tb&run=true)

<a name="VOICES">
### 3.3 Voices
</a>

Each *Start* block runs as a separate voice in Music Blocks. (When
you click on the Run button, all of the *Start* blocks are run
concurrently.)

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/voices1.svg'/>

If we put our song into an action...

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/voices2.svg'/>

...we can run it from multiple *Start* blocks.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/voices3.svg'/>

It gets more interesting if we shift up and down octaves.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/voices4.svg'/>

And even more interesting if we bring the various voices offset in time.

[RUN LIVE](http://walterbender.github.io/musicblocks/?file=MusicBlocks_frerejacques.tb&run=true)

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/drum3.svg'/>

A special "drum" version of the *Start* block is available for laying
down a drum track. Any pitch blocks encounted while starting from a
drum will be played as `C2` with the default drum sample. In the
example above, all of the notes in `chunk` will be played with a kick
drum.

<a name="GRAPHICS">
### 3.4 Adding graphics
</a>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/graphics1.svg'/>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/graphics2.png'/>

Turtle graphics can be combined with the music blocks. By placing
graphics blocks, e.g., *Forward* and *Right*, inside of *Note value*
blocks, the graphics stay in sync with the music. In this example, the
turtle moves forward each time a quarter note is played. It turns
right during the eighth note. The pitch is raised by one half step,
the pen size decreases, and the pen color increases at each step in
the inner repeat loop.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/graphics3.svg'/>

In this example, the graphics are synchronized to the music by placing
the graphics commands inside of *Note value* blocks.

[RUN LIVE](http://walterbender.github.io/musicblocks/?file=MusicBlocks_sync_graphics.tb&run=true)

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/fibonacci3.svg'/>

In this example, because the computation and graphics are more
complex, a *Free-time* block is used to decouple the graphics from the
master clock. The "Free-time* block prioritizes the sequence of
actions over the specified rhythm.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/graphics4.png'/>

<a name="INTERACTIONS">
### 3.5 Interactions
</a>

There are many ways to interactive with Music Blocks, including
tracking the mouse position to impact some aspect of the music.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/interactive.svg'/>

For example, we can launch the phrases (chunks) interactively. When
the mouse is in the lower-left quadrant, `chunk` is played;
lower-right quadrant, `chunk1`; upper-left quadrant, `chunk2`; and
upper-right quadrant, `chunk3`.

[RUN LIVE](http://walterbender.github.io/musicblocks/?file=MusicBlocks_interactivefrerejacques.tb&run=true)

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/interactive2.svg'/>

In the example above, a simple two-key piano is created by associating
*click* events on two different turtles with individual notes. Can you
make an 8-key piano?

[RUN LIVE](http://walterbender.github.io/musicblocks/?file=MusicBlocks_twokey_piano.tb&run=true)

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/interactive3.svg'/>

You can also add a bit of randomness to your music. In the top example
above, the *One-of* block is used to randomly assign either `Do` or
`Re` each time the *Note value* block is played. In the bottom example
above, the *One-of* block is used to randomly select between `chunk1`
and `chunk2`.

<a name="WIDGETS">

------------
</a>
[Previous Section (3. Programming with Music)](#PROGRAMMING-WITH-MUSIC) | [Back to Table of Contents](#TOC) | [Next Section (5. Beyond Music Blocks)](#BEYOND-MUSIC-BLOCKS)

This section of the guide will talk about the various Widgets that can be added to Music Blocks
to enhance your experience.

<a name="status">
### 4.1 Status
</a>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/status1.svg'/>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/status2.svg'/>

The *Status widget* is a tool for inspecting the status of Music
Blocks as it is running. By default, the key, BPM, and volume are
displayed. Also, each note is displayed as it is played. There is one
row per voice in the status table.

Additional *Print* blocks can be added to the *Status* widget to
display additional music factors, e.g., duplicate, transposition,
skip, [staccato](#MORE-TRANSFORMATIONS), [slur](#MORE-TRANSFORMATIONS), and [graphics](#GRAPHICS) factors, e.g., x, y, heading,
color, shade, grey, and pensize.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/status3.svg'/>

You can do additional programming within the status block. In the
example above, the volume is divided by 10 before being displayed.
<a name = "GENERATION">
### 4.2 Generating Chunks of Notes 
</a>

Using the Pitch-Time Matrix, it is possible to generate chunks of notes at a much faster speed.

<a name="pitch-time">
#### 4.2.1 The Pitch-Time Matrix
</a>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix1.svg'/>

Music Blocks provides a widget, the *Pitch-time Matrix*, as a scaffold
for getting started.

Once you've launched Music Blocks in your browser, start by clicking
on the *Pitch-time Matrix* stack that appears in the middle of the
screen. (For the moment, ignore the *Start* block.) You'll see a grid
organized vertically by pitch and horizontally by rhythm.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix2.svg'/>

The matrix in the figure above has three *Pitch* blocks and one
*Rhythm* block, which is used to create a 3 x 3 grid of pitch and
time.

Note that the default matrix has five *Pitch* blocks, hence, you will
see five rows, one for each pitch. (A sixth row at the bottom is used
for specifying the rhythms associated with each note.) Also by
default, there are two *Rhythm* blocks, which specifies six quarter
notes followed by one half note. Since the *Rhythm* blocks are inside
of a *Repeat* block, there are fourteen (2 x 7) columns for selecting
notes.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix3.svg'/>

By clicking on individual cells in the grid, you should hear
individual notes (or chords if you click on more than one cell in a
column). In the figure, three quarter notes are selected (black
cells). First `Re 4`, followed by `Mi 4`, followed by `Sol 4`.

<img
src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/header-icons/play-button.svg'
height="36"/>

If you click on the *Play* button (found in the top row of the grid),
you will hear a sequence of notes played (from left to right): `Re 4`,
`Mi 4`, `Sol 4`.

<img
src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/header-icons/export-chunk.svg'
height="36"/>

Once you have a group of notes (a "chunk") that you like, click on the
*Save* button (just to the right of the *Play* button). This will
create a stack of blocks that can used to play these same notes
programmatically. (More on that below.)

You can rearrange the selected notes in the grid and save other chunks
as well.

<img
src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/header-icons/sort.svg'
height="36"/>

The *Sort* button will reorder the pitches in the matrix from highest
to lowest and eliminate any duplicate *Pitch* blocks.

<img

height="36"/>

You can hide the matrix by clicking on the *Close* button (the right-most
button in the top row of the grid.)

<img
src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/header-icons/erase-button.svg'
height="36"/>

There is also an Erase button that will clear the grid.

Don't worry. You can reopen the matrix at anytime (it will remember
its previous state) and since you can define as many chunks as you
want, feel free to experiment.

Tip: You can put a chunk inside a *Pitch-time Matrix* block to generate
the matrix to corresponds to that chunk.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix4.svg'/>

The chunk created when you click on the matrix is a stack of
blocks. The blocks are nested: an *Action* block contains three *Note
value* blocks, each of which contains a *Pitch* block. The *Action*
block has a name automatically generated by the matrix, in this case,
chunk. (You can rename the action by clicking on the name.). Each note
has a duration (in this case 4, which represents a quarter note). Try
putting different numbers in and see (hear) what happens. Each note
block also has a pitch block (if it were a chord, there would be
multiple *Pitch* blocks nested inside the Note block's clamp). Each
pitch block has a pitch name (`Re`, `Mi`, and `Sol`), and a pitch
octave; in this example, the octave is 4 for each pitch. (Try changing
the pitch names and the pitch octaves.)

To play the chuck, simply click on the action block (on the word
action). You should hear the notes play, ordered from top to bottom.

#### 4.2.2 The Rhythm Block
</a>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix6.svg'/>

*Rhythm* blocks are used to generate rhythm patterns in the
*Pitch-time Matrix* block. The top argument to the *Rhythm* block
is the number of notes. The bottom argument is the duration of the
note. In the top example above, three columns for quarter notes
would be generated in the matrix. In the middle example, one column
for an eighth note would be generated. In the bottom example, seven
columns for 16th notes would be generated.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix7.svg'/>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix8.svg'/>

You can use as many *Rhythm* blocks as you'd like inside the
*Pitch-time Matrix* block. In the above example, two *Rhythm*
blocks are used, resulting in three quarter notes and six eighth
notes.

<a name= "CREATING-TUPLETS">
#### 4.2.3 Creating Tuplets
</a>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix9.svg'/>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix10.svg'/>

Tuplets are a collection of notes that get scaled to a specific
duration. Using tuplets makes it easy to create groups of notes that
are not based on a power of 2. In the example above, three quarter
notes&mdash;defined in the *Rhythm* block&mdash;are played in the time of a
single quarter note. The result is three twelfth notes.

You can mix and match *Rhythm* blocks and *Tuplet* blocks when
defining your matrix.

#### 4.2.5 Using individual notes in the matrix
</a>
<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/matrix11.svg'/>

You can also use individual notes when defining the grid. These blocks
will expand into *Rhythm* blocks with the corresponding values.


<a name="rhythms">
### 4.3 Generating Rhythms
</a>

The *Rhythm Ruler* block is used to launch a widget similar to the
*Pitch-time Matrix* block. The widget can be used to generate rhythmic
patterns.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/rhythm1.svg'/>

The argument to the *Rhythm Ruler* block specifies the duration that
will be subdivided to generate a rhythmic pattern. By default, it is 1
/ 1, e.g., a whole note.

The *Set Drum* blocks contained in the clamp of the *Rhythm Ruler*
block indicates the number of rhythms to be defined simultaneously. By
default, two rhythms are defined. The embedded *Rhythm* blocks define
the initial subdivision of each rhythm ruler.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/rhythm2.svg'/>

When the *Rhythm Ruler* block is clicked, the *Rhythm Ruler* widget is
opened. It contains a row for each rhythm ruler. An input in the top
row of the widget is used to specify how many subdivisions will be
created within a cell when it is clicked. By default, 2 subdivisions
are created.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/rhythm3.svg'/>

As shown in the above figure, the top rhythm ruler has been divided
into two half-notes and the bottom rhythm ruler has been divided into
three third-notes. Clicking on the *Play* button to the left of each row
will playback the rhythm using a drum for each beat. The *Play-all*
button on the upper-left of the widget will play back all rhythms
simultaneously.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/rhythm4.svg'/>

The rhythm can be further subdivided by clicking in individual
cells. In the example above, two quarter-notes have been created by
clicking on one of the half-notes.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/rhythm5.svg'/>

The *Save stack* button will export rhythm stacks.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/rhythm6.svg'/>

These stacks of rhythms can be used to define rhythmic patterns used
with the *Pitch-time Matrix* block.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/rhythm7.svg'/>

The *Save drum machine* button will export *Start* stacks that will
play the rhythms as drum machines.

<a name="modes">
### 4.4 Musical Modes
</a>

Musical modes are used to specify the relationship between [intervals](#INTERVALS-AND-ARTICULATION)
(or steps) in a scale. Since Western music is based on 12 half-steps
per octave, modes speficy how many half steps there are between each
note in a scale.

By default, Music Blocks uses the *Major* mode, which, in the [Key](#SETTING) of
C, maps to the white keys on a piano. The intervals in the *Major*
mode are `2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1`. Many other common modes are
built into Music Blocks, including, of course, *Minor* mode, which
uses `2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2` as its intervals.

Note that not every mode uses 7 intervals per octave. For example, the
*Chromatic* mode uses 11 intervals: `1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1`. The *Japanese* mode uses only 5 intervals: `1, 4,
2, 3, 2],`. What is important is that the sum of the intervals
in an octave is 12 half-steps.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/mode1.svg'/>

The *Mode* widget lets you explore modes and generate custom
modes. You invoke the widget with the *Custom mode* block. The mode
specified in the *Set key* block will be the default mode when the
widget launches.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/mode2.svg'/>

In the above example, the widget has been launched with *Major* mode
(the default). Note that the notes included in the mode are indicated by
the black boxes, which are arrayed in a circular pattern of tweleve
half-steps to complete the octave.

Since the intervals in the *Major* mode are `2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1`, the
notes are `0`, `2`, `4`, `5`, `7`, `9`,`11`, and `12` (one octave
above `0`).

The widget controls run along the toolbar at the top. From left to
right are:

*Play all*, which will play a scale using the current mode;

*Save*, which will save the current mode as the *Custom* mode and save
 a stack of *Pitch* blocks that can be used with the *Pitch-time
 Matrix* block;

*Rotate counter-clockwise*, which will rotate the mode
 counter-clockwise (See the example below);

*Rotate clockwise*, which will rotate the mode clockwise (See the
 example below);

*Invert*, which will invert the mode (See the example below);

*Undo*, which will restore the mode to the previous version; and

*Close*, which will close the widget.

You can also click on individual notes to activate or deactivate them.

Note that the mode inside the *Custom mode* block is updated whenever
the mode is changed inside the widget.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/mode3.svg'/>

In the above example, the *Major* mode has been rotated clockwise,
transforming it into *Dorian*.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/mode4.svg'/>

In the above example, the *Major* mode has been rotated
counter-clockwise, transforming it into *Locrian*.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/mode5.svg'/>

In the above example, the *Major* mode has been inverted, transforming
it into *Phrygian*.

Note: The build-in modes in Music Blocks can be found in [musicutils.js] (https://github.com/walterbender/musicblocks/blob/master/js/musicutils.js#L68).

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/mode6.svg'/>

The *Save* button exports a stack of blocks representing the mode that
can be used inside the *Pitch-time Matrix* block.

<a name="pitch-drum">
### 4.5 The Pitch-Drum Matrix
</a>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/drum2.svg'/>

The *Set Drum* block is used to map the enclosed pitches into drum
sounds. Drum sounds are played in a monopitch using the specified drum
sample. In the example above, a `kick drum` will be substitued for
each occurance of a `Re` `4`.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/drum8.svg'/>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/drum5.svg'/>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/drum6.svg'/>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/drum7.svg'/>

As an expedience for creating mapping with the *Set Drum* block, we
provide the *Drum-Pitch* Matrix. You use it to map between pitches and
drums. The output is a stack of *Set Dum* blocks.

<a name="stairs">
### 4.6 Generating Arbitrary Pitches
</a>

The *Pitch Staircase* block is used to launch a widget similar to the
*Pitch-time Matrix*, which can be used to generate different pitches
using a given pitch and musical proportion.

The *Pitch* blocks contained in the clamp of the *Pitch Staircase*
block define the pitches to be initialized simultaneously. By default,
one pitch is defined and it have default note "la" and octave "3".

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/pitchstaircase0.svg'/>

When *Pitch Staircase* block is clicked, the *Pitch Staircase* widget is
initialized. The widget contains row for every *Pitch* block contained
in the clamp of the *Pitch Staircase* block. The input fields in the top
row of the widget specify the musical proportions used to create new
pitches in the staircase. The inputs correspond to the numerator and
denominator in the proportion resectively. By default the proportion
is 3:2.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/pitchstaircase1.svg'/>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/pitchstaircase2.svg'/>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/pitchstaircase3.svg'/>

Clicking on the *Play* button to the left of each row will playback
the notes associated with that step in the stairs. The *Play-all*
button on the upper-left of the widget will play back all the pitch
steps simultaneously. A second *Play-all* button to the right of the
stair plays in increasing order of frequency first, then in 
decreasing order of frequency as well, completing a scale.

The *Save stack* button will export pitch stacks. For example, in the above 
configuration, the output  from pressing the *Save stack* button is shown below:

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/pitchstaircase4.svg'/>

These stacks can be used with the *Pitch-time Matrix* block to define
the rows in the matrix.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/pitchstaircase5.svg'/>

<a name="slider">
### 4.7 Generating Arbritary Pitches
</a>

The *Pitch Slider* block is used to launch a widget that is used to
generate arbitray pitches. It differs from the *Pitch Staircase* widget in
that it is used to create frequencies that vary continuously within
the range of a specified octave.

Each *Sine* block contained within the clamp of the *Pitch Slider* block defines the initial pitch
for an ocatve.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/pitchslider0.svg'/>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/pitchslider1.svg'/>

When the *Pitch Slider* block is clicked, the *Pitch Slider* widget is
initialized. The widget will have one column for each *Sine* block in
the clamp. Every column has a slider that can be used to move up or
down in frequency, continuously or in intervals of 1/12th of the
starting frequency. The mouse is used to move the frequency up and down continuously. Buttons are
used for intervals. Arrow keys can also be used to move up and down,
or between columns.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/pitchslider0a.svg'/>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/pitchslider2.svg'/>

CLicking in a column will extact the corresponding *Note* blocks, for example:

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/pitchslider3.svg'/>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/pitchslider4.svg'/>

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/pitchslider5.svg'/>

<a name="tempo">
### 4.8 Changing Tempo
</a>

The *Tempo* block is used to launch a widget that enables the user to
visualize Tempo, defined in beats per minute (BPM). When the *Tempo* block
is clicked, the *Tempo* widget is initialized.

The *Master Beats per Minute* block contained in the clamp of the
*Tempo* block sets the initial tempo used by the widget. This
determines the speed at which the ball in the widget moves back and
forth. If BPM is 60, then it will take one second for the ball to move
across the widget. A round-trip would take two seconds.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/tempo0.svg'/>

The top row of the widget holds the *Play/pause* button, the *Speed
up* and *Slow down* buttons, and an input field for updating the
Tempo.

<img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/musicblocks/master/guide/tempo1.svg'/>

You can also update the tempo by clicking twice in spaced succession in the
widget: the new BPM is determined as the time between the two clicks. For
example, if there is 1/2 seconds between clicks, the new BPM will be set as 120.
