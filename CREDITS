Music Blocks is a fork of TurtleArtJS created by Walter
Bender. (Turtle Blocks JS has many
[contributors](https://github.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/graphs/contributors).

Devin Ulibarri has contributed functional and user-interface
designs. Many of his contributions were inspired by the music
education ideas, representations and practices (e.g. aspects of
matrix, musical cups) developed and published by Dr. Lawrence Scripp
with whom Devin studied at New England Conservatory and for whom he
worked at Affron Scripp & Associates, LLC.

Richard Hermann, Professor of Theory and Composition at the University
of New Mexico, shared ideas and his publications with our team that
inspired new features and improvements.

Some of the graphics were contributed by Chie Yasuda (the Mouse theme
originates with her). She also has been very patient with Devin as he
works on this--thanks Chie!

Much of the initial coding was done by Yash Khandelwal as part of
