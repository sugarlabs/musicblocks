Artwork(GIF) --> Video

Use video formats for animated content
----------------------

**Why you should replace animated GIFs with video ?**

Large GIFs are inefficient for delivering animated content. By converting large GIFs to videos, you can save big on users' bandwidth. Consider using MPEG4/WebM videos for animations and PNG/WebP for static images instead of GIF to save network bytes.

**Create MPEG videos**

There are a number of ways to convert GIFs to video. [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) is the tool used in this guide. To use FFmpeg to convert the GIF, my-animation.gif to an MP4 video, run the following command in your console:

```
ffmpeg -i my-animation.gif my-animation.mp4
```

This tells FFmpeg to take my-animation.gif as the input, signified by the -i flag, and to convert it to a video called my-animation.mp4.


**Create WEBM Videos**

WebM videos are much smaller than MP4 videos, but not all browsers support WebM so it makes sense to generate both.

To use FFmpeg to convert my-animation.gif to a WebM video, run the following command in your console:

```
ffmpeg -i my-animation.gif -c vp9 -b:v 0 -crf 41 my-animation.webm
```

**Replace the GIF image with a video**

Animated GIFs have three key traits that a video needs to replicate:

-They play automatically.
-They loop continuously (usually, but it is possible to prevent looping).
-They're silent.

Luckily, you can recreate these behaviors using the <video> element.

  
```
<video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
  <source src="my-animation.webm" type="video/webm">
  <source src="my-animation.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
  ```
