tools for exploring musical and mathematical concepts in an
integrative and fun way.

## <a name="RUNNING_MUSIC_BLOCKS"></a>Running Music Blocks

Music Blocks is available under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL), a free, copyleft license.

Music Blocks is designed to run in a web browser.

The easiest way to run Music Blocks is to open [Music
Blocks](https://musicblocks.sugarlabs.org) in your browser (Firefox,
Chrome, and Opera work best).

If you want to run Music Blocks offline,
[download](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/archive/master.zip)
or [git clone](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks.git) this repo
and run through a local server.

## <a name="HOW_TO_SET_UP_A_LOCAL_SERVER"></a>How to set up a local server

Some web browsers (e.g., Firefox v68) have restrictions that prevent
Music Blocks from running from the file://. To circumvent this, we
provide instructions for launching a web server on your computer to
which you can connect to Music Blocks.

(1) In a terminal, cd to the directory where you downloaded Music
Blocks (e.g., <code>cd /musicblocks</code>)

(2) If you do not have Python installed, you'll need to install
it. (Get it from https://www.python.org) You can test for Python in a
terminal: <code>python</code>. Type <code>exit()</code> to exit
Python.
 
(3) After cloning the musicblocks repository, run the command:

```
$ npm run serve
```

This works on all Operating Systems with Python.

On Windows sytems with multiple Python installations, it is
recommended to use this command instead:

```
$ npm run winserve
```

NOTE: Make sure you can run either <code>python</code> or
<code>py</code> from your terminal.

(4) You should see a message: <code>Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 3000
...</code> since the HTTPServer is set to start listening on Port
3000.

(5) Open your favorite browser and run <code>localhost:3000</code> or
<code>127.0.0.1:3000</code>.

## <a name="USING_MUSIC_BLOCKS"></a>Using Music Blocks

Once Music Blocks is running, you'll want suggestions on how to use it.
See [Using Music
Blocks](http://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/tree/master/documentation/README.md)
and [Music Blocks
Guide](http://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/tree/master/guide/README.md)

## <a name="MODIFYING_MUSIC_BLOCKS"></a>Modifying Music Blocks

The core code for Music Blocks resides in the [js
directory](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/tree/master/js). Individual
modules are described in more detail in [js
README.md](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/blob/master/js/README.md)

Note: As with any change, please make your own copy by cloning this
[respository](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks.git). Make
your changes, test them, and then make a pull request.

for more details.

## <a name="CREDITS"></a>Credits

Music Blocks is a fork of
[TurtleBlocksJS](https://github.com/sugarlabs/turtleblocksjs)
created by Walter Bender.

Devin Ulibarri has contributed functional and user-interface
designs. Many of his contributions were inspired by the music
education ideas, representations and practices (e.g. aspects of
matrix, musical cups) developed and published by [Larry
Scripp](http://www.larryscripp.net/) with whom Devin studied at New
England Conservatory and for whom he worked at Affron Scripp &
Associates, LLC, [Center for Music and the Arts in Education
(CMAIE)](http://centerformie.org/), and [Music in
Education](http://music-in-education.org/) Some of the initial graphics
were contributed by [Chie Yasuda](http://www.chieyasuda.com).

Much of the initial coding specific to Music Blocks was done by
Yash Khandelwal as part of Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2015. Hemant
Kasat contributed to additional widgets as part of GSoC
2016. Additional contributions are being made by Tayba Wasim, Dinuka
Tharangi Jayaweera, Prachi Agrawal, Cristina Del Puerto, and Hrishi
Patel as part of GSoC 2017. During GSoC 2018, Riya Lohia developed a
Temperament Widget. Ritwik Abhishek added a keyboard widget and a
pitch-tracking widget.

Many students contributed to the project as part of Google Code-in
(2015&ndash;16, 2016&ndash;17, and 2017&ndash;2018). Sam Parkinson
built the Planet during GCI 2016&ndash;17. Emily Ong designed our
mouse icon and Euan Ong redesigned the Planet code as a series of GCI
tasks in 2017&ndash;18; Austin George refactored the toolbars as a
series of GCI tasks in 2018.
