Using Music Blocks
------------------

Music Blocks is designed to run in the browser. It is derived from
Turtle Blocks JS which can be found
[here](https://github.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs). You can run
the software locally from the index.html file, from the
[github](http://walterbender.github.io/musicblocks/) repo, or by setting up a
local server.

If you want to run Music Blocks offline, download this repo and point
your browser to the index.html file found in the musicblocks directory
on your local file system.

Sugar users can run Music Blocks as an app embedded in the Browse
activity (See [Music Blocks
Embedded](http://github.com/sugarlabs/music-blocks-embedded-activity))
or simply open Music Blocks in Browse.

See [Using Music
Blocks](http://github.com/walterbender/musicblocks/tree/master/documentation) and [Music Blocks Guide](http://github.com/walterbender/musicblocks/tree/master/guide)

Music Blocks is a fork of TurtleArtJS created by Walter
Bender. (Turtle Blocks JS has many
[contributors](https://github.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/graphs/contributors)).

Devin Ulibarri has contributed functional and user-interface
designs. Many of his contributions were inspired by the music
education ideas, representations and practices (e.g. aspects of
matrix, musical cups) developed and published by Dr. Lawrence Scripp
