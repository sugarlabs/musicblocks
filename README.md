Music Blocks is a fork of
[TurtleBlocksJS](https://github.com/sugarlabs/turtleblocksjs)
created by Walter Bender.

Devin Ulibarri has contributed functional and user-interface
designs. Many of his contributions were inspired by the music
education ideas, representations and practices (e.g. aspects of
matrix, musical cups) developed and published by [Larry
Scripp](http://www.larryscripp.net/) with whom Devin studied at New
England Conservatory and for whom he worked at Affron Scripp &

Much of the initial coding of the fork from Turtle Blocks was done by
Yash Khandelwal as part of Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2015. Hemant
Kasat contributed to additional widgets as part of GSoC
2016. Additional contributions are being made by Tayba Wasim, Dinuka
Tharangi Jayaweera, Prachi Agrawal, Cristina Del Puerto, and Hrishi
Patel as part of GSoC 2017. During GSoC 2018, Riya Lohia developed a
Temperament Widget. Ritwik Abhishek added a keyboard widget and a
pitch-tracking widget.

Many students contributed to the project as part of Google Code-in
(2015&ndash;16, 2016&ndash;17, and 2017&ndash;2018). Sam Parkinson
built the Planet during GCI 2016&ndash;17. Euan Ong redesigned the
