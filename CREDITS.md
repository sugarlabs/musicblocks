Marvin Minsky, the inventor of the digital synthesizer, inspired a
music extension of the Logo programming language in the early
1970s. Many of the ideas expressed in Music Blocks originated with
Minsky.

Music Blocks is a fork of TurtleArtJS created by Walter Bender.

Devin Ulibarri has contributed functional and user-interface
designs. Many of his contributions were inspired by the music
education ideas, representations and practices (e.g. aspects of
matrix, musical cups) developed and published by Dr. Lawrence Scripp
with whom Devin studied at New England Conservatory and for whom he
worked at Affron Scripp & Associates, LLC.

Richard Hermann, Professor of Theory and Composition at the University
of New Mexico, shared ideas and his publications with our team that
inspired new features and improvements.

Some of the graphics were contributed by Chie Yasuda (the Mouse theme
originates with her). She also has been very patient with Devin as he
works on this&mdash;thanks Chie!

Much of the initial coding of the fork from Turtle Blocks was done by
Yash Khandelwal as part of Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2015. Hemant
Kasat contributed to additional widgets as part of GSoC
2016. Additional contributions are being made by Tayba Wasim, Dinuka
Tharangi Jayaweera, Prachi Agrawal, Cristina Del Puerto, and Hrishi
Patel as part of GSoC 2017.

Many students contributed to the project as part of Google Code-in
(2015&ndash;16, 2016&ndash;17, and 2017&ndash;2018).
