Marvin Minsky, the inventor of the digital synthesizer, inspired a
music extension of the Logo programming language in the early
1970s. Many of the ideas expressed in Music Blocks originated with
Minsky.

Music Blocks is a fork of TurtleArtJS created by Walter
Bender. (Turtle Blocks JS has many
[contributors](https://github.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/graphs/contributors).

Devin Ulibarri has contributed functional and user-interface
designs. Many of his contributions were inspired by the music
education ideas, representations and practices (e.g. aspects of
matrix, musical cups) developed and published by Dr. Lawrence Scripp
with whom Devin studied at New England Conservatory and for whom he
worked at Affron Scripp & Associates, LLC.

Richard Hermann, Professor of Theory and Composition at the University
of New Mexico, shared ideas and his publications with our team that
inspired new features and improvements.
