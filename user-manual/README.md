# Music Blocks User Manual 

[Music Blocks](https://walterbender.github.io/musicblocks/) is a free and open source, browser based software, designed basically for students to learn music in fun and interactive way.
To get started with Music Blocks, newbies need to have a fundamental understanding of the software, what are the things can be done and importantly how things can be done. To address these requirements, Music Blocks has two guides: '[Using Music Blocks](https://github.com/walterbender/musicblocks/tree/master/guide)' and '[Music Blocks Guide](https://github.com/walterbender/musicblocks/tree/master/documentation)'. But the existing user guides lacks most of the important information about the software components, how each building blocks in the software can be related to music and especially some examples of how to create music with the software. **Objective of this project** is to create a user manual which would be a comprehensive guide while providing samples and related explanations.
