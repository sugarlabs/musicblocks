Internationalization
====================

We are using PO files as the basic mechanism for managing translation
of Turtle Blocks. We'd prefer that translators work with the Sugar
Labs [Pootle
server](http://translate.sugarlabs.org/projects/TurtleBlocksJS/) and
we will work with you to set up a PO file for your language if one is
not presently on the server. Also feel free to make Pull Requests
directly to this repository with updates to exisiting (or new) PO
files.
